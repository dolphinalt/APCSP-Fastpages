Row Score Explaintation Notes/Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input, functionality, and output of the program, which had the user input a state and then select different pieces of information to display on the screen. Moreover, the written response also clear documented the purpose (function) of the program was to provide the user with information on a us state, and that the actual purpose was to help with memorization and to learn new things. | | . Data Abstraction | 0/1 | The program and response does include the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (statelist), and the purpose it serves. However, it does not show how the data is stored within the list. As such, it does not earn the point for this row of the rubric. Moreover, the description in the written response for the list was also inaccurate as the list statelist only represents the name of the states. | &lt;/tr&gt; Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response does an good job at stating how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to code each peice of data independently from each other, resulting in greater code complexity. | Collegeboard says that the written response does not go a good job of explaining in detail on how the operation would be more complex to store. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0/1 | Although the written reponse demonstrates the usage of a function updatescreen in order to assign an index to each state. This function does not contain any parameters that are passed to it. Thus the program does not earn the point in this row. | Collegeboard decided that the written response also inaccurately described the main function of the procedure | . Algorithm Implementation | 0/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of many if statements to implement sequencing and selection. However, the program does not indicate the use of any form of a loop or anything similar to denote a use of iteration in the program. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response shows the results and scenario of the both proceudres to identify that their program works as expected according to the set purpose and function | The written reponse does not properly show different parameters that are plugged into the procedures. Additionally, it does not describe the result in detail, instead, it only gives a breif overview of what happens on screen instead. | . &lt;/table&gt; ### **Submission 4** Row Score Explaintation Notes/Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input and output of the program, which was to use certain keyboard keys such as a and d to move the boat, and eventually add to a total count of fish if the hook comes into contact with a fish. THe function and purpose were also stated explicity, with the purpose being to reduce boredom, and the function being to simulate a fishing game. | | . Data Abstraction | 1/1 | The program and response does include the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (fishtypes), and the purpose it serves. The list is in the form of an array that stores the total amount of fish caught by the user. Later, the list is also shown to be used to output the total number of fish of each type caught. | | . Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response does an good job at stating how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to resort to the use of individual variables to store each fish and the number of that fish caught, which would not only be cumbersome and produce clutter, but would also be hard to add new fish types in the future. The student also address and refutes the possibility of using individual variables for each type of fish and it&#39;s total. | | . Procedural Abstraction | 1/1 | The written reponse demonstrates usage of a function clone movement in order to determine the spawning of the fishes including their location, distance, and final position. This function consists of 5 arguments serving to define the range and speed of the fish. The student also explains how this specific helps the functionality of the program as a whole, as it serves to randomly spawn fishes with different attributes to increase the difficulty of the game. | | . Algorithm Implementation | 1/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of a loop to implement iteration to move the fish clone until it eithe reaches the end of the screen, or is touched by the hook. Sequencing could also be observed in the function as it creates a clone of a fish first before executing the loop and it&#39;s following logic. Moreover, the algorithm also uses an if statement to implement selection in the code to determine whether of not if the clone is touching the edge of the screen. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response clearly shows the inputting of two different inputs, one where the clone is touching the right edge of the screen, and another one where it doesn&#39;t. Moreover, the response clearly details the results of each procedure. The end results of the program are also the expected results. | According to collegeboard, this student did not earn the point for this row because they only tested for the alternate code segments, rather than actual arguments, parameters, and inputs into the function itself. | . ## Reflection: ### **on any discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring** I was consistantly grading much more leinently than college board did, might be because I am still not very familiar for every single one of the requirements to be met. ### **on what your program will need to fulfill all requirements** On my program, I need to make sure that I have detailed testing in order to fulfill all requirements for the performance task. ### **on the criteria and why a submission may have failed to meet the standard** The submissions that failed to meet the standerds failed due to them not being able to meet every single sub-requirement, while I was not checking each sub-requirement in very much detail. | .",

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import os from random import randint import math as m . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() oogway.position(0.00,0.00) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | rounds up to the next integer | . floor(x) | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | Runs the factorial function | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * num1 = input() num1 = int(num1) num2 = input() num2 = int(num2) print(ceil(num1)) print(ceil(num2)) print(floor(num1)) print(floor(num2)) print(lcm(num1,num2)) print(gcd(num1,num2)) print(factorial(num1)) print(factorial(num2)) print(pow(num1,num2)) print(pow(num2,num1)) . 10 2 10 2 10 .

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a Python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . . . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . Python Example: . def binary_search(array, find): # where array is the given array and find is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible sublists... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == find: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; find: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half else: # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found # case 1 array = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] find = 10 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 10 is not present at index 3 # Question: What is the maximum number of iterations given this array? # case 2 array = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] find = 30 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 30 is not present in array # case 3 array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 ] find = 83 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 83 is not present at index 82 # you can see how efficient this is, only requiring 7 iterations instead of {insert number of iterations going 1 by 1 would take because im too lazy to calculate it} # Question: What is the maximum number of iterations given this array? .",

This inspired me, and gave me an idea for a project next tirmester: . trying to make the game myself | making a stat tracker for some other games (eg FPS win%) | . Art projects . I also went to see the work n the AP Studio Art classroom, and was very impressed by what I saw. Many of the drawings were extremely realistic and even looked like photographs. The many hours that must have been poured into projects like these truly show the dedication they have for this project. I also went to the ceramics classroom, and was very captivated by the banana dolphin project, as I thought it was funny and also really like dolphins.

            "content": "Quiz blog . Mental health class at yale: Psychology and the Good Life . Students at yale thought that there was a lot of stress, can’t get the full usage of college, little time to do what they want . It takes a crisis to realize something is wrong . 40% of college students are stressed above normal . 1/3 of college students are “depressed to the point they cant function” . 40% of college students feel hopeless . just under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety, and this has gone up to 60% in 2017 . This is really bad, especially if these students are going to the workforce . Yale realized that they could attempt to fix this by psychology research . Researching on the mental of happy people . Teach students on how to become more like these people . This class has 2 parts, the psychology behind it and how to apply it . do the same practices that happy people do as part of the syllabus . A lot of students took this class, showing that it was really beneficial . What this class teaches: . we can controls a lot more of our happiness than we think | half glass or half empty type of person | there is some part of happiness is controlled by genes, the other half is controlled by you | we need to take the initiative to controls it and make ourselves happy | What we think makes us happy doesn’t actually make us happy and vice versa | ex: lottery winner is happy on the day of, then not after | it takes a lot of effort to make us happy | to be more happy you need to make changes that take effort every day | GI joe fallacy, knowing is part of the battle but not half | you need to work to build upon the knowledge | Our minds lies to us about whenever we are happy | EX: our minds forecast we need money so we can be happy, then that determines you job but it doesn’t actually make you happy | Our mind is greedy | The “limit” to how happy salary can make you is 75k, after that a jump in salary doesn’t make you happier | Forecasts of happiness are mostly fake, actual happiness doesn’t come from forecasting | happy people prioritize people in their life | Experiment about being social vs avoiding social contact | Forecast how the subject thinks its going to go | said that talking would make them less happy and solitude would make them more happy | results were the exact opposite | to be happier, spend time trying to be happier | helping others will help you be happier | very happy people spend time with and for others | another study with money and spending it for yourself or spending money for someone else and the amount of money they spent | Results: amount of money doesn’t matter, spending money for others makes you happier than spending it for yourself | treating ourselves doesn’t actually make us happier | make time for gratitude | our minds fixate on negative things | talking about negative things will reduce your happiness | talking about good things even just once a week will increase your happiness | Thanking someone randomly isn’t awkward, it bumps up both person’s happiness | healthy practices matter much more than we think | EX: excessive | excessive helps our physical and mental health | cardio makes people happier for 24 hours | high school students sleep 4-5 hours a night | this has a negative impact on their mood | having low amounts of sleep causes most mental health crises | Being present in the moment helps boost your mood | having your mind wandering to happy things, sad things, or even neutral things will hurt your mental | Notice what you are doing when you do something happy | savor the good things in life | meditation helps you reduce the areas in your brain that wander | be wealthy in time | people who have more time are happier | sacrificing time to have money makes you more depressed | sacrificing money to have time makes you less depressed | students were much happier when they had an hour to themselves, not allowed to do other homework | . We need to change the culture about mental health everywhere . we need to take the idea that something is wrong and do something about it . For college students alcohol is a problem because of coping with their mental . As we get older we get happier, this is because after you retire you have more time, have more time for connections, etc. .",

            "content": "Python hacks . Usage of loops . Referenced code: . import getpass # question format, gets user answer def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg # lists of questions/answers prompts=[&quot;What command would you use to display text into the terminal?&quot;, &quot;What command would you use to ask the user for information?&quot;, &quot;What is the keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;, &quot;How would you write a print statement to concatenate a string containing variable A with string &#39;Hello&#39;?

[Y/n]&quot;) if rsp.lower() == &quot;y&quot;: print(&quot;Lets get started!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Bye :(&quot;) exit() # cycle through all questions, score the questions for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) # calculate percentage percentage=(correct/questions)*100 percentage=round(percentage, 2) # report score print(f&quot;You got a total of {correct} out of {questions} ({percentage}%)!&quot;) . For loop . As seen here: . for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) . The for loop is looping through all questions and grading the responses. It is doing this by referencing the index of the value in the list of all questions. I am able to make sure that no matter the size of the list, I am always able to be confident that I will loop through all questions, as I am using the the variable questions, representing the total amount of entries in the list. . If statement . As seen here: . def gradeResponse(response, answer): global correct # convert to lowercase so ppl don&#39;t yell at me for scoring them as wrong when they went &quot;prinT&quot; if response.lower() == answer: print(f&quot;{response} is correct! nGood job :D&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(f&quot;{response} is incorrect! nBetter luck next time :(&quot;) . The if statement is checking if the answers response corresponds to the answer in the answers list. If so, then it will award the user with a point, as well as letting them know that they were correct. If the user was wrong, meaning their response didn&#39;t match the defined answer, the program will not add a point, and let the user know that they have gotten the question incorrect. . While loop . As there is no while loop in this program, I will provide an example of a possible usage of a while loop here: . i = 0 while i &lt; 10: i += 1 print(f&quot;Hello World {i}!&quot;) . This while statement will print out the statement &quot;Hello world {i}&quot;, where i is the current value that the loop is on. This loop will print out a total of 10 statements, from the values of 1, all the way up to 10. .",

Code explanation . I import the getpass library that way I can personalize it and say the user name. The function question_with_response asks the question and returns the user answer, named msg. For every question in the list questions, I pass the variable msg into rsp and send it to the gradeResponse function, along with the corresponding answer. gradeResponse will then check if the answer is correct and award a point to the user if it is. At the end of the quiz, it will display how many out of the total questions were correct. .",

Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: are input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Procedural Abstraction: a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: method or function . Why are procedures effective?: reduces the complexity and amount of code present . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): n=int(n) n=bin(n) return n[2:] binary=convertToBinary(96) print(binary) . 1100000 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . Array.prototype.max = function() { return Math.max.apply(null, this); }; Array.prototype.min = function() { return Math.min.apply(null, this); }; function maxMin(array, operation) { var res = &quot;Error: invalid input(s)&quot; if (operation == &quot;max&quot;) { res = array.max() } else if (operation == &quot;min&quot;) { res = array.min() } return res } var array = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var array = [35, 2, 65, 7, 8, 9, 12, 121, 33, 99] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) . i can&#39;t run javascript on my notebook but here is the expected result: .

Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): output = [] for char in x: decimal = ord(char) binary = bin(decimal) binary = (binary)[2:] output.append(f&quot;0{binary}&quot;) return output binary_output = charToBinary(&quot;APCSP&quot;) print(binary_output) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
