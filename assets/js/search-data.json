            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a Dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # duplicates are removed # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Hashmaps/Hashtables cannot accept duplicate values # . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

(C) The ability to resolve errors in domain name system (DNS) lookups . (D) The ability to use multiple protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), Internet protocol (IP), and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) to transfer data . My answer: D . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing. . Q17: . A large data set contains information about all students majoring in computer science in colleges across the United States. The data set contains the following information about each student. . The student’s gender . The state in which the student attends college . The student’s grade point average on a 4.0 scale . Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set? . (A) Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects? . (B) How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state? . (C) What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science? . (D) Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science? . My answer: C . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because the data set stores information about an individual student’s gender and state. This information can be aggregated to extract information about the percentage of female majors in each state. . Q19: . A retailer that sells footwear maintains a single database containing records with the following information about each item for sale in the retailer’s store. . Item identification number . | Footwear type (sneakers, boots, sandals, etc.) . | Selling price (in dollars) . | Size . | Color . | Quantity available . | . Using only the database, which of the following can be determined? . (A) Which items listed in the database are not currently in the store . (B) Which colors are more popular among men than women . (C) Which type of footwear is most popular among adults . (D) The total number of shoes sold in a particular month . My answer: D . Correct answer: A . The correct answer is A because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available, the retailer can search for all item identification numbers that have a quantity of 0. . Q20: . When a cellular telephone user places a call, the carrier transmits the caller’s voice as well as the voice of the person who is called. The encoded voices are the data of the call. In addition to transmitting the data, the carrier also stores metadata. The metadata of the call include information such as the time the call is placed and the phone numbers of both participants. For which of the following goals would it be more useful to computationally analyze the metadata instead of the data? . I. To determine if a caller frequently uses a specific word . II. To estimate the number of phone calls that will be placed next Monday between 10:30 A.M. and noon. . III. To generate a list of criminal suspects when given the telephone number of a known criminal . (A) I only . (B) II only . (C) II and III only . (D) I, II, and III . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because both II and III are correct choices. II is correct because the repository of stored metadata includes time, so information about the time of calls can be analyzed to make predictions about future calls. In addition, III is correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers of the two parties of a call. Given one phone number, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person. . Q27: . Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case. . Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image? . (A) Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality. . (B) Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black. . (C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed. . (D) Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture. . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because if a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored. . Q28: . A video-streaming Web site uses 32-bit integers to count the number of times each video has been played. In anticipation of some videos being played more times than can be represented with 32 bits, the Web site is planning to change to 64-bit integers for the counter. Which of the following best describes the result of using 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers? . (A) 2 times as many values can be represented. . (B) 32 times as many values can be represented. . (C) 232 times as many values can be represented. . (D) 322 times as many values can be represented. . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because when you go from 32 bits to 64 bits you are increacing by a factor of 32, therefore 2^32 means 232 times as many values can be represented. . Q29: . An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences? . (A) 2 more items can be uniquely identified. . (B) 10 more items can be uniquely identified. . (C) 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified. . (D) 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified. . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because Using 6-bit binary sequences allows for 26 or 64 different items to be identified. Using 7-bit binary sequences allows for 27 or 128 different items to be identified. Thus there are two times as many items that can be uniquely identified. . Q30: . Each student that enrolls at a school is assigned a unique ID number, which is stored as a binary number. The ID numbers increase sequentially by 1 with each newly enrolled student. If the ID number assigned to the last student who enrolled was the binary number 1001 0011, what binary number will be assigned to the next student who enrolls? . (A) 1001 0100 . (B) 1001 0111 . (C) 1101 0100 . (D) 1101 0111 . My answer: C . Correct answer: A . The correct answer is A because when you add one, you need to shift every bit over by 1, 1001 0100 is the correct answer. . Q36: . For which of the following situations would it be best to use a heuristic in order to find a solution that runs in a reasonable amount of time? . (A) Appending a value to a list of n elements, which requires no list elements be examined. . (B) Finding the fastest route that visits every location among n locations, which requires n! possible routes be examined. . (C) Performing a binary search for a score in a sorted list of n scores, which requires that fewer than n scores be examined. . (D) Performing a linear search for a name in an unsorted database of n people, which requires that up to n entries be examined. . My answer: D . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because if an algorithm has a factorial efficiency, it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q37: . A graphic artist uses a program to draw geometric shapes in a given pattern. The program uses an algorithm that draws the shapes based on input from the artist. The table shows the approximate number of steps the algorithm takes to draw different numbers of shapes. . Number of Shapes Drawn Number of Steps . 4 | 17 | . 5 | 24 | . 6 | 35 | . 7 | 50 | . Based on the values in the table, which of the following best characterizes the algorithm for drawing n shapes, where n is a very large number? . (A) The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n steps to draw n shapes. . (B) The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n2 steps to draw n shapes. . (C) The algorithm runs in an unreasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n steps to draw n shapes. . (D) The algorithm runs in an unreasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n2 steps to draw n shapes. . My answer: A . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because as n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n2, which would make the algorithm polynomial. An algorithm with an efficiency that approximates n2 is said to run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q41: . A student is writing a program that is intended to replace each negative value in a particular column of a spreadsheet with the value 0. Which of the following procedures is most likely to be useful in the student’s program? . (A) A procedure containsNegatives, which returns true if any negative values appear in the column and returns false otherwise. . (B) A procedure countNegatives, which returns the number of negative values that appear in the column. . (C) A procedure findNegative, which returns the row number of the first negative value that appears in the column or -1 if there are no negative values. . (D) A procedure minimum, which returns the minimum value that appears in the column. . My answer: A . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because using this procedure would allow the student to identify the location where a negative value occurs, and then change that value to 0. This process can continue with repeated calls to the procedure until there are no more negative values. . Q49: . A teacher stores the most recent quiz scores for her class in the list scores. The first element in the list holds the maximum possible number of points that can be awarded on the quiz, and each remaining element holds one student’s quiz score. Assume that scores contains at least two elements. Which of the following code segments will set the variable found to true if at least one student scored the maximum possible number of points on the quiz and will set found to false otherwise? . (A) . (B) . (C) . (D) . My answer: A . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because the code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Space and Time Complexity",
            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . The space and time complexity of an algorithm is important because it can affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it will take a long time to run if the input size is large, but an algorithm that has a time complexity of O(ln(n)) will run in a very short amount of time no matter the input size. Similarly, if an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it will require a lot of memory if the input size is large. | .

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . This is a space complexity problem because the amount of memory used by the algorithm is affected by the size of the input. The amount of memory used by the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input. | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Example of Matrix Multiplication . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . A visualization of calculating the fibonacci sequence . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) .

Procedural Abstraction Hacks . I see procedural abstraction in this implememtation because the code is broken down into smaller functions that are called in the main function.

From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data?

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

My answer: C Correct answer: A An email address by its self won’t cause much harm, however, an email password would. The answer is A because cookies stored in the user’s Web browser can contain saved passwords, creditcard info, and more, all accessable without a password. . Q4 . My answer: D Correct answer: A The correct answer here is D, as having the data in a database will only need to more data stored, increacing the need for data compression. However, having all the data in a singular database allows for easy analysis of the data within calling sessions, and make updates and decisions based on the data. . Q7 . My answer: C Correct answer: A Of the three answer choices, only I was not needed by the original system, as there was no need for the customer to verbally disclose what they wanted to pick, all they needed was to select a number on a keypad. However, a call into the system is still nesscary, therefore choice III was needed. . Q29 . My answer: D Correct answer: B The correct answer here was B, because in step 4, a is being assigned the value of NOT (a OR b) AND c. a was assigned with true in step one, b assigned with false and c assigned with true. Therefore, NOT (a OR b) is the opposite of a or b, which is the opposite of true, being false. false AND c is false, therefore a is assigned with false. Taking this value of a equaling false and doing c AND a results in false AND false, which is false. Therefore, the correct answer is B. . Q49 . My answer: D Correct answer: B Simulations will lack important details. Wether it is because of the programers forgeting a detail or an unexpected detail pops up, simulations will not be able to account for every detail, and may omit details to make it easier to implement. .",

It was a great experience, and I also got many inspirations for future projects, such as projects in which users can review items or locations from many other users, in a fassiopn similar to something like yelp.

The way the artists use different means or designs to express their emotions and feelings is amazing, and I was very inspired by the works of art that I saw. I also learned that I should try to be more creative in my own art, and try to express my own feelings and emotions through my art, rather than just making art for the sake of making art. . . . . . .",

Q16 (4) . The answer choice I picked (B) is wrong because searching will only be looking through the list whereas the correct answer choice (C) is correct because selecting will be selecting different values to be added together. . Q45 (4) . The answer choice I picked (A) is wrong because a heuristic approach means to approximate a solution. This is used in cases where the problem cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time by an algorithm, therefore an approximation is required. This is why the correct answer choice (C) is correct. . Q47 (4) . The answer choice I picked (D) is wrong in most cases, as sorting a list of numbers can be done with a precise answer and in a reasonable amount of time. The correct answer choice is (C) because a program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations cannot be found in a reasonable amount of time, as there are an infinite amount of routes. However, an approximate solution is acceptable here, as it will not have a large impact. . Q49 (4) . The answer choice I picked (B) is wrong, because there are some problems that computers cannot solve, even given an algorithm and an infinite amount of time.

Secondly, it allows for much faster cracking of passwords, stealing of data, and many more issues. | Allows for faster rendering, more processing power, solving of problems that otherwise couldn’t be solved | Large power draw, efficient password cracking, exploiting of servers and services | . Ad Blockers | Overview Benefits Harms . Add blockers are used to block unwanted ads from websites. However useful this may be, there are a few obvious flaws. Some include that small companies will lose money from this, as their source of income (ads) are completely blocked. | Allows for more focus on work and projects etc, as there are no ads distracting you. | Loss of a significant portion of income for companies. | . Tik Tok - Dopamine issue | Overview Benefits Harms . Tik Tok is hard wired to deliver as much Dopamine as possible, in the shortest amount of time possible. This results in loss of attention for the user when doing everyday tasks. As the app conditions their brain on an constant overload and influx in information and entertainment, when doing a task that does not have this same information overload, the user will experience severe boredom and a lack of stimulation. | Provides entertainment for the user, relieves stress, etc. | Results in a loss of attention when doing mundane tasks | . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? . The best way to empower yourself in a digital world is steer clear from things that may harm self confidence, or may put you in danger. For example, try not to spend too much time on the toxic environment of social media. Another thing is to try and stay away from talking about specifics online, such as your age, name, gender, and many more. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping them to learn about the dangers of internet, how to secure themselves from outside threats. You can also guide them about basic internet etiquette that way they don’t become the bullier, as well as the victim. At del norte, there are already many clubs relating to this topic, such as cybersecurity clubs, CyberAegis, and many more. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Yes, the idea that the only way to prevent the negative effects of internet is to stay off of it as well as the idea that social media is always bad are some types of red tapes blocking digital empowerment. These barriers are shown at Del Norte, as shown with the extremely restrictive access to parts of the windows pcs at school, where in reality it would be a good idea to allow students to be exposed to these security options. Elsewhere, many parents are under the impression that all social media is bad, however, if you learn to use social media properly, it isn’t always bad. . Project Approval .

Pros Cons . Prevents inexperienced students from messing with sensitive settings | The people who don’t know about advanced settings will never know, while the people who do feel restricted | . Prevents students from visiting inappropriate sites or getting distracted by games | Many websites that may be useful are also blocked, such as independent blogs that may have valuable information | . Creates a overall more focused environment | Creates a confined environment | . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . Some concerns I have for the digital divide is the restriction of opportunities for people without good laptops. I personally have a decently powerful laptop at home, however, for others this may not be true. Some people may not have a powerful enough laptop to, for example, run video editing programs. This prevents them from attending digital media classes, completely restricting them from going down a path that may have been very appealing to them. Another example is practicing red teaming or ethical hacking. As it is the best practice to run all pen testing software and exploits on a virtual machine, some laptops may not support this virtualization or may not have the power to run a machine with enough power to support a heavy virtual machine running on top of the host os. .",

Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . Some PII I have seen on projects in APCSP include calculating of grades (asking for your grade, GPA, classes, etc.) sharing of school schedules (asking for your classes, teachers, etc.) and sharing of personal information (asking for your name and grade). . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . My feelings about PII are that some PII may be beneficial, while some may be harmful. For example, ways that PII may be beneficial include things such as linkedin, where you can be recognized for your skills and accomplishments. However, PII can be harmful if used for malicious purposes or if it isn’t kept securely. This can include leaked passwords, credentials, and these can be leveraged for malicious gain. In my personal exposure, I have a linkedin, therefore my PII is already on the internet. Not only this, but my school profile has a lot of PII, which may be at risk for leaks. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Good passwords are passwords that are hard to brute force, have a secure amount of characters, and are not easily guessed. Bad passwords are the opposite, having a small amount of characters, being easy to guess, and being easy to brute force. Some examples of good and bad passwords are “password” and “password123” being bad, and “password123!” and “password123!@#” being good. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is the use of two-factor authentication. This is where the user must provide two pieces of information to authenticate, such as a password and a code sent to their phone. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . Symmetric encryption is where the encryption is reversible, and the encryption method is hte same as the decryption method. An example of symmetric encryption are DES, Triple DES and AES. Asymmetric encryption is where the encryption method is not the same as the decryption method. This is especially useful in authentication. Some examples of asymmetric encryption are pubkey authentication, RSA, and the Diffe-Hellman exchange method. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . An example of encryption we used in AWS deployment is the SSH public key authentication. This is a type of asymmetric encryption where the message is encrypted by the private key and must be decrypted by the public key. Without the matching public key for the corresponding private key, there is no way to decrypt the message. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . I have fallen for a phishing scheme when I was in elementary school. There was a popup for a page that I was on that had told me that I had many viruses on my machine, and being naive, I clicked on the link. It took me to a page that looked like a Windows update page, and it asked me to download a program to remove the viruses. I downloaded the program, and it ended up being a virus. We weren’t able to remove the virus, and we had to reinstall Windows. Some other phishing techniques can include fake emails, fake websites, and fake phone calls. .",

            "content": "Big Idea 5.3 Computing Bias . From the activities, I gathered a lot of important information regarding the state of bias within computing and computer programs. Wether it is the bias for more news within Facebook favored for the older generation, or the content within Tiktok favored for the younger generation, biases in which content or information is served to you vary greatly. In addition, some biases may be such as the example with the facial recognition software, not being able to recognize some skin tones better than others. This may be due to the developers not using enough testing information, or having a flawed algorithm. This can be fixed using crowdsourcing . Big Idea 5.4 Crowdsourcing . Our entire project is based off of crowdsourcing, as we are collecting information from users for every part of our project. For logging in and signing up we are retrieving the users full names, MySchedules will be collecting user schedules, MyClasses will be getting user reviews of classes, and MyGPA (being the best example) collects user GPAs and compares them to all the other collected GPAs and calculates different statistics. To achieve our Crowdsourcing goals, we could ask every student in APCSP to sign up for or program and fill out all the different applications according to their own schedules, GPA, or class reviews. .",

Row Score Explaintation Notes/Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input, functionality, and output of the program, which had the user input a state and then select different pieces of information to display on the screen. Moreover, the written response also clear documented the purpose (function) of the program was to provide the user with information on a us state, and that the actual purpose was to help with memorization and to learn new things. | | . Data Abstraction | 0/1 | The program and response does include the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (statelist), and the purpose it serves. However, it does not show how the data is stored within the list. As such, it does not earn the point for this row of the rubric. Moreover, the description in the written response for the list was also inaccurate as the list statelist only represents the name of the states. | &lt;/tr&gt; Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response does an good job at stating how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to code each peice of data independently from each other, resulting in greater code complexity. | Collegeboard says that the written response does not go a good job of explaining in detail on how the operation would be more complex to store. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0/1 | Although the written reponse demonstrates the usage of a function updatescreen in order to assign an index to each state. This function does not contain any parameters that are passed to it. Thus the program does not earn the point in this row. | Collegeboard decided that the written response also inaccurately described the main function of the procedure | . Algorithm Implementation | 0/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of many if statements to implement sequencing and selection. However, the program does not indicate the use of any form of a loop or anything similar to denote a use of iteration in the program. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response shows the results and scenario of the both proceudres to identify that their program works as expected according to the set purpose and function | The written reponse does not properly show different parameters that are plugged into the procedures. Additionally, it does not describe the result in detail, instead, it only gives a breif overview of what happens on screen instead. | . &lt;/table&gt; ### **Submission 4** Row Score Explaintation Notes/Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input and output of the program, which was to use certain keyboard keys such as a and d to move the boat, and eventually add to a total count of fish if the hook comes into contact with a fish. THe function and purpose were also stated explicity, with the purpose being to reduce boredom, and the function being to simulate a fishing game. | | . Data Abstraction | 1/1 | The program and response does include the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (fishtypes), and the purpose it serves. The list is in the form of an array that stores the total amount of fish caught by the user. Later, the list is also shown to be used to output the total number of fish of each type caught. | | . Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response does an good job at stating how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to resort to the use of individual variables to store each fish and the number of that fish caught, which would not only be cumbersome and produce clutter, but would also be hard to add new fish types in the future. The student also address and refutes the possibility of using individual variables for each type of fish and it&#39;s total. | | . Procedural Abstraction | 1/1 | The written reponse demonstrates usage of a function clone movement in order to determine the spawning of the fishes including their location, distance, and final position. This function consists of 5 arguments serving to define the range and speed of the fish. The student also explains how this specific helps the functionality of the program as a whole, as it serves to randomly spawn fishes with different attributes to increase the difficulty of the game. | | . Algorithm Implementation | 1/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of a loop to implement iteration to move the fish clone until it eithe reaches the end of the screen, or is touched by the hook. Sequencing could also be observed in the function as it creates a clone of a fish first before executing the loop and it&#39;s following logic. Moreover, the algorithm also uses an if statement to implement selection in the code to determine whether of not if the clone is touching the edge of the screen. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response clearly shows the inputting of two different inputs, one where the clone is touching the right edge of the screen, and another one where it doesn&#39;t. Moreover, the response clearly details the results of each procedure. The end results of the program are also the expected results. | According to collegeboard, this student did not earn the point for this row because they only tested for the alternate code segments, rather than actual arguments, parameters, and inputs into the function itself. | . ## Reflection: ### **on any discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring** I was consistantly grading much more leinently than college board did, might be because I am still not very familiar for every single one of the requirements to be met. ### **on what your program will need to fulfill all requirements** On my program, I need to make sure that I have detailed testing in order to fulfill all requirements for the performance task. ### **on the criteria and why a submission may have failed to meet the standard** The submissions that failed to meet the standerds failed due to them not being able to meet every single sub-requirement, while I was not checking each sub-requirement in very much detail. | .",

A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however. answer options: The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias | The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. | If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation. | The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output. | | . | Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why? answer options No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results. | No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment. | Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output. | Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences. | | . | Sylvia is an industrial engineer working for a sporting goods company.

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import os from random import randint import math as m . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() oogway.position(0.00,0.00) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | rounds up to the next integer | . floor(x) | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | Runs the factorial function | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * num1 = input() num1 = int(num1) num2 = input() num2 = int(num2) print(ceil(num1)) print(ceil(num2)) print(floor(num1)) print(floor(num2)) print(lcm(num1,num2)) print(gcd(num1,num2)) print(factorial(num1)) print(factorial(num2)) print(pow(num1,num2)) print(pow(num2,num1)) . 10 2 10 2 10 .

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a Python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . . . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . Python Example: . def binary_search(array, find): # where array is the given array and find is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible sublists... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == find: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; find: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half else: # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found # case 1 array = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] find = 10 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 10 is not present at index 3 # Question: What is the maximum number of iterations given this array? # case 2 array = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] find = 30 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 30 is not present in array # case 3 array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 ] find = 83 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 83 is not present at index 82 # you can see how efficient this is, only requiring 7 iterations instead of {insert number of iterations going 1 by 1 would take because im too lazy to calculate it} # Question: What is the maximum number of iterations given this array? .",

This inspired me, and gave me an idea for a project next tirmester: . trying to make the game myself | making a stat tracker for some other games (eg FPS win%) | . Art projects . I also went to see the work n the AP Studio Art classroom, and was very impressed by what I saw. Many of the drawings were extremely realistic and even looked like photographs. The many hours that must have been poured into projects like these truly show the dedication they have for this project.

            "content": "Quiz blog . Mental health class at yale: Psychology and the Good Life . Students at yale thought that there was a lot of stress, can’t get the full usage of college, little time to do what they want . It takes a crisis to realize something is wrong . 40% of college students are stressed above normal . 1/3 of college students are “depressed to the point they cant function” . 40% of college students feel hopeless . just under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety, and this has gone up to 60% in 2017 . This is really bad, especially if these students are going to the workforce . Yale realized that they could attempt to fix this by psychology research . Researching on the mental of happy people . Teach students on how to become more like these people . This class has 2 parts, the psychology behind it and how to apply it . do the same practices that happy people do as part of the syllabus . A lot of students took this class, showing that it was really beneficial . What this class teaches: . we can controls a lot more of our happiness than we think | half glass or half empty type of person | there is some part of happiness is controlled by genes, the other half is controlled by you | we need to take the initiative to controls it and make ourselves happy | What we think makes us happy doesn’t actually make us happy and vice versa | ex: lottery winner is happy on the day of, then not after | it takes a lot of effort to make us happy | to be more happy you need to make changes that take effort every day | GI joe fallacy, knowing is part of the battle but not half | you need to work to build upon the knowledge | Our minds lies to us about whenever we are happy | EX: our minds forecast we need money so we can be happy, then that determines you job but it doesn’t actually make you happy | Our mind is greedy | The “limit” to how happy salary can make you is 75k, after that a jump in salary doesn’t make you happier | Forecasts of happiness are mostly fake, actual happiness doesn’t come from forecasting | happy people prioritize people in their life | Experiment about being social vs avoiding social contact | Forecast how the subject thinks its going to go | said that talking would make them less happy and solitude would make them more happy | results were the exact opposite | to be happier, spend time trying to be happier | helping others will help you be happier | very happy people spend time with and for others | another study with money and spending it for yourself or spending money for someone else and the amount of money they spent | Results: amount of money doesn’t matter, spending money for others makes you happier than spending it for yourself | treating ourselves doesn’t actually make us happier | make time for gratitude | our minds fixate on negative things | talking about negative things will reduce your happiness | talking about good things even just once a week will increase your happiness | Thanking someone randomly isn’t awkward, it bumps up both person’s happiness | healthy practices matter much more than we think | EX: excessive | excessive helps our physical and mental health | cardio makes people happier for 24 hours | high school students sleep 4-5 hours a night | this has a negative impact on their mood | having low amounts of sleep causes most mental health crises | Being present in the moment helps boost your mood | having your mind wandering to happy things, sad things, or even neutral things will hurt your mental | Notice what you are doing when you do something happy | savor the good things in life | meditation helps you reduce the areas in your brain that wander | be wealthy in time | people who have more time are happier | sacrificing time to have money makes you more depressed | sacrificing money to have time makes you less depressed | students were much happier when they had an hour to themselves, not allowed to do other homework | . We need to change the culture about mental health everywhere . we need to take the idea that something is wrong and do something about it . For college students alcohol is a problem because of coping with their mental . As we get older we get happier, this is because after you retire you have more time, have more time for connections, etc. .",

For loop . As seen here: . for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) . The for loop is looping through all questions and grading the responses. It is doing this by referencing the index of the value in the list of all questions. I am able to make sure that no matter the size of the list, I am always able to be confident that I will loop through all questions, as I am using the the variable questions, representing the total amount of entries in the list. . If statement . As seen here: . def gradeResponse(response, answer): global correct # convert to lowercase so ppl don&#39;t yell at me for scoring them as wrong when they went &quot;prinT&quot; if response.lower() == answer: print(f&quot;{response} is correct! nGood job :D&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(f&quot;{response} is incorrect! nBetter luck next time :(&quot;) . The if statement is checking if the answers response corresponds to the answer in the answers list. If so, then it will award the user with a point, as well as letting them know that they were correct. If the user was wrong, meaning their response didn&#39;t match the defined answer, the program will not add a point, and let the user know that they have gotten the question incorrect. . While loop . As there is no while loop in this program, I will provide an example of a possible usage of a while loop here: . i = 0 while i &lt; 10: i += 1 print(f&quot;Hello World {i}!&quot;) . This while statement will print out the statement &quot;Hello world {i}&quot;, where i is the current value that the loop is on. This loop will print out a total of 10 statements, from the values of 1, all the way up to 10. .",

Code explanation . I import the getpass library that way I can personalize it and say the user name. The function question_with_response asks the question and returns the user answer, named msg. For every question in the list questions, I pass the variable msg into rsp and send it to the gradeResponse function, along with the corresponding answer. gradeResponse will then check if the answer is correct and award a point to the user if it is. At the end of the quiz, it will display how many out of the total questions were correct. .",

Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: are input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Procedural Abstraction: a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: method or function . Why are procedures effective?: reduces the complexity and amount of code present . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): n=int(n) n=bin(n) return n[2:] binary=convertToBinary(96) print(binary) . 1100000 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . Array.prototype.max = function() { return Math.max.apply(null, this); }; Array.prototype.min = function() { return Math.min.apply(null, this); }; function maxMin(array, operation) { var res = &quot;Error: invalid input(s)&quot; if (operation == &quot;max&quot;) { res = array.max() } else if (operation == &quot;min&quot;) { res = array.min() } return res } var array = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var array = [35, 2, 65, 7, 8, 9, 12, 121, 33, 99] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) . i can&#39;t run javascript on my notebook but here is the expected result: .

Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): output = [] for char in x: decimal = ord(char) binary = bin(decimal) binary = (binary)[2:] output.append(f&quot;0{binary}&quot;) return output binary_output = charToBinary(&quot;APCSP&quot;) print(binary_output) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .
