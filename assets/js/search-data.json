            "content": "What is SASS? . Sass is a preprocessor language that&#39;s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that&#39;s used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you&#39;re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser. Fun fact CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. . SCSS vs. CSS . Understanding the differences between SCSS and CSS . What is CSS . CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user. . | However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course. . | . CSS Example . This is an example of CSS that can be used to change body text of an HTML document | Hack Question:Can you guess what its changing style of the text to? This is changing the text style to be Arial, font size 16, and color red. | . css . body{ color: #0000FF; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . What is SCSS . SCSS is short for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. | SCSS very similar to CSS but the difference comes with the fact that SCSS extends the functionality of CSS while also making it simpler. What this allows us to do is it enables us to things like nested styling, functions, mixins, variables, inheritance (more on these later) and so on. | . Sass Code Example . $blue: #0000FF; body{ color: $blue; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . This example is doing the same thing as the other code segment above but the difference being that here we defined the color as $blue which makes it much easier for us to recall later on. In fact, we have done this before, if you have been using the dark mode/midnight theme then go ahead and navigate your your _sass folder and check out the dark-mode.scss and you&#39;ll see something similar to the example above | . So which one is better to use? . CSS tends to be better for really simple styling where not many complex or nested styles are required and small projects that doesn&#39;t require a lot of customization. | SCSS on the other hand is very good for more complex styling and working with a project with more than one page where maybe lots of customization is needed. Such as the projects we made last and first trimester. | . Modular SCSS . Understanding how to use modular SCSS . Modular SCSS allows you to break multiple different files and then be able to compile them into a single CSS file | How do you do this? Well all you need to do is have _filenames.scss so that is compiled into its own file | Now after adding the to the file name you can import it into you file without the and all the styles will be carried over. | The benefits of a partial is that it allows you to big websites and allows you to break up the code in multiple components and easily make changes instead of having to go through a huge file. | All styles in the partial will be added and can be used into the main file as if they were defined in the main file. | . File 1 _variable.scss . $primary-button-color: #009494; $hover-color: black; $menu-color: #f2f2f2; . File 2 style.scss . We can see the importing of the .scss file&#39;s content into the other main .scss file style.scss | . {@import &#39;variables&#39;; @import &quot;{{ site.theme }}&quot;;} /* &quot;row style&quot; is flexible size and aligns pictures in center */ .row { align-items: center; display: flex; } /* &quot;column style&quot; is one-third of the width with padding */ .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } .menu a { // float: left; display: block; color: $menu-color; text-align: center; // padding: 14px 16px; text-decoration: none; } .menu a:hover { background: $primary-button-color; color: $hover-color; } . Nesting . What is nesting? Where did the birds come from? . Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). | Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read. | When we make HTML we often nest different elements within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it. | The problem is that in regular CSS we don&#39;t have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code. | . Warning:Don&#39;t nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name. ## Sass Nesting | Through nesting the ul, li, and a selectors within the nav selector makes your CSS better and increases its readability overall. | . nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } li { display: inline-block; } a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } . CSS - Lack of Nesting . We can see that through the lack of nesting the CSS is not as organized and needs extra information to be able to make it more clear exactly what is being targeted. | . nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } nav li { display: inline-block; } nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } . Variables . What is a variable? . A variable is a container that stores information so for instance when you multiple places that refer to one value you can just use the variable name instead of the value. | This is valuable in SASS because it allows you to reuse that value in multiple places throughout you stylesheet. | Variables in CSS preprocessors such as Sass allow you to store information that you can reuse in your stylesheet, such as font stacks, colors, or any other CSS value you anticipate needing. The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. | . Pro Tip:The reason SASS variables are better than variables in regular CSS is that they are more consider and easier to read with a much simpler syntax. Fun Fact: Variables in SASS came before CSS and often SASS has features long before they are actually added to CSS as a whole. . Variable Example Syntax . $variable-name: value; | Once the sass is processed the variable name is replaced with the value throughout the program. | . $main-font: Calibri, sans-serif; $main-color: #000; $main-color-hover: #000; . Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language like in python we can use operators to see if values are equal, add, divide, subtract, multiply, etc. | SASS has a lot of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language as well. They can include == to check if two values are equal and != to check if two values are not equal | + to add two values together | - to subtract two values | * to multiply two values | / to divide two values | % to find the remainder of two values | &lt; to check if one value is less than another | &gt; to check if one value is greater than another | &lt;= to check if one value is less than or equal to another | &gt;= to check if one value is greater than or equal to another | Also there is and, or, &amp; not to be able to use boolean operations | . | . Operator Example Syntax . Operators are used in this example to perform string concatenation | . // Html &lt;p id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;original text and&lt;/p&gt; // SASS #testing:after{ content: &quot; some&quot; + &quot; more&quot; + &quot; text&quot;; } // Output original text and some more text . Conditional Statements . There are conditional statements in SASS just like in Python and JavaScript they work the same way as well. | Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Such as if a certain condition is true then do this, if it is false then do that and so on. | SASS has @if which allows for different styles based on if a boolean expression was true or false. | SASS has @else which allows for different set of styles if the if condition was not met or false. | SASS has @else if which allows for an alternative conditions to be run if the first is not met. | . $color: red; button { @if $color == red { background-color: $color; } } // @else: allows you to provide an alternative set of styles to apply if the condition in the @if statement isn&#39;t met $color: blue; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else { background-color: $color; } } // @else if: allows you to provide multiple alternative conditions to test $color: green; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else if $color == blue { background-color: blue; } @else { background-color: $color; } } . Loops In Sass . Loops are present in SASS through the @for and @while decorators, along with @each. | Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met just like in any other programming language. . For Loops: Are used to iterate through a value like a list or a range of numbers | While Loops: Are used to iterate through a block of code until a certain condition is met such as a value is being equal to a certain value through an incrementing or decrementing a variable or any other condition that is met. | . | When using while loops they can be necessary but it is better to use @each and @for as it will make it clear and be able to compile faster. . | Side Note: In SASS lists care a any group of values that are separated by a comma or a space there is no special brackets used like in python or javascript. Lists can be searched for values however they are immutable meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. . | . Some Code Examples of Loops and Lists . // A for each loop is used to interact with a group of sizes changing // the size of the element for each item in the list $sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px; @each $size in $sizes { .icon-#{$size} { font-size: $size; height: $size; width: $size; } } // @each: allows you to loop over a list of values and generate styles $colors: red, green, blue; @each $color in $colors { .color-#{$color} { background-color: $color; } } . @debug list.index(1px solid red, 1px); // 1 @debug list.index(1px solid red, solid); // 2 @debug list.index(1px solid red, dashed); // null . @use &quot;sass:math&quot;; /// Divides `$value` by `$ratio` until it&#39;s below `$base`. @function scale-below($value, $base, $ratio: 1.618) { @while $value &gt; $base { $value: math.div($value, $ratio); } @return $value; } $normal-font-size: 16px; sup { font-size: scale-below(20px, 16px); } . $base-color: #036; @for $i from 1 through 3 { ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) { background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%); } } // @for: allows you to loop over a range of values and generate styles @for $i from 1 through 3 { .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; } } . Functions in SASS . What is a function? . A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. This is a great method to be able to reuse code and processes in a manner that is more efficient and allows for the reuse of code. We do this all the time in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. | . SASS functions . Sass Functions allow you to define complex calculations and transformations that can be used throughout your stylesheet and allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, plus you can generate content dynamically. . | There a are built in functions and ones you can make on your own like languages such as JavaScript and Python. . | SASS functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate colors, work with strings, and more. . | Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages, but they can be used within SASS stylesheets to generate CSS code dynamically. . | . Using Built-in Functions . Like Python and Javascript SASS provides a variety of built-in functions for math, color manipulation, string manipulation, and more. | . Math Functions . SASS has many functions that allow you to be able to perform wide range of math operations similar to the ones present in python including more complex operations. | . .round(1.2); // returns 1 .ceil(1.2); // returns 2 .floor(1.2); // returns 1 .abs(-1.2); // returns 1.2 .min(1, 2, 3); // returns 1 .max(1, 2, 3); // returns 3 .random(1, 100); // returns a random number between 1 and 100 . Color Functions . Color is an important component of any website and SASS provides a wide range of functions that allow you to manipulate colors in a variety of ways. | . .lighten(#007fff, 20%); // returns a lighter shade of blue .darken(#007fff, 20%); // returns a darker shade of blue .opacify(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more opaque .transparentize(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more transparent .mix(#007fff, #ff0000, 50%); // returns a mix of two colors . String Functions . SASS provides a variety of string functions that allow you to manipulate strings. Here are some examples: | . .to-upper-case(&quot;hello world&quot;); // returns &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; .to-lower-case(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;); // returns &quot;hello world&quot; .str-index(&quot;hello world&quot;, &quot;world&quot;); // returns the index of the first occurrence of &quot;world&quot; .str-insert(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; world&quot;, 5); // inserts &quot; world&quot; into &quot;hello&quot; at position 5 . Creating Custom Functions . In addition to using built-in functions, you can also create your own functions in SASS using the @function name(arguments){} | @return is similar to the return statement in JavaScript and Python. It returns a value from a function. | Functions take input values, perform calculations, and return a result. Here&#39;s an example of a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle: | . @function rectangle-area($width, $height) { @return $width * $height; } // Usage: $area: rectangle-area(10px, 20px); // Returns 200px . Or you can also make a different kind of function that increases the font size to the factorial of a inputted number. | . @function factorial($number){ $calculated: 1; @for $_ from 1 through $number { $calculated: $calculated*$number; } @return $calculated; } #testing { font-size: factorial(3); } . //Combining functions and loops to achieve different sass effects @function sum($numList){ $sum: 0; @each $num in $numList { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $num; } @function tri($num){ $sum: 0; @for $i from 1 through $num { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $sum; } @function max($nums){ $i:0; $value:0px; @while $i&lt;length($nums){ @if $value&lt;list.nth($nums,$i){ $value:list.nth($nums,$i); } } } . Custom functions are very powerful, and can be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be used throughout your stylesheets. . | SASS functions are a powerful feature that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. By using built-in functions and creating your own custom functions, you can greatly extend the capabilities of your SASS stylesheets. . | . Mixins . Mixin what is a mix in what are we mixing in? . Mixins are a way to make groups of CSS that you want to reuse throughout your site anywhere you please. | Mixins are a form of template and that you can use to build on top of to make different features later on this prevents you from having to write the same code over and over again. | This is a form of encapsulation in your CSS and is a great way to make your code more organized and easier to read. | Mixins can also take in arguments and be able to be used to apply effects on certain elements if that is a feature you want to add to your site. However unlike functions which also take arguments mixins cannot return values. | To use a mixin declare it with @mixin and then incorporate with @include. | . Inheritance . What is inheritance? . In general programming concept where the child class can inherit properties from the parent class. These properties can be changed and modified in the child class. This prevents code from being repeated and makes the code more usable and flexible. | In SASS we have a similar concept that can be used as well we can create base styles and then have other styles inherit from them and then we can change them as we please. | We can do that by through using @extend .name-of-class and then we can add more styles to it as we please. Simple as that | . Mixin &amp; Inheritance Code Example . // example of @mixin @mixin button { width: auto; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #21807c; border: 3px solid black; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; grid-column: span 1; grid-row: span 1; // creates smooth animation effect transition: all 0.5s; } // default button theme for calculator and stopwatch buttons. Both will follow the same button format .button { // uses the scss from the @mixin @include button; } /* styling for the calculator clear button */ .calculator-button-clear { // @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e68b1c; } /* styling for the calculator equals button */ .calculator-button-equals { // another @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e70f0f; } .

            "title": "Big Idea 2 - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improving the application&#39;s performance. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and efficiently, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build helpful applications that meet the needs of your users. . PLEASE DON&#39;T OPEN THE POPCORN HACKS, WE WILL OPEN THEM DURING THE PRESENTATION . Basics of Class and User Data . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . Because Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, everything in it represents an object. Lists, dictionaries, functions, etc. are all examples of Python objects. Generally speaking, a Python object is an entity of data items and methods describing the behavior of those items. . A Python class is a template used to create Python objects. We can think of it as a cooking recipe, where all the ingredients and their quantities are listed, and the whole process of cooking is described step-by-step. . In this case, we can compare a cake recipe to a class, and a cake cooked following that recipe to an object (i.e., an instance of that class). Using the same recipe (class), we can create many cakes (objects). This is the essence of creating a class in Python: to define data elements and the rules establishing how these elements can interact and change their state — and then use this framework to build various objects in a set way, instead of creating them from scratch every time. . Let&#39;s look at a few examples: . class Bikes: name = &quot;&quot; gear = 0 # create objects of class bike1 = Bikes() # objectName = ClassName() bike2 = Bikes() . Now that we have our class and object defined, we can now run code to modify certain attributes of our objects. . bike1.gear = 11 bike1.name = &quot;Mountain Bike&quot; bike2.gear = 13 bike2.name = &quot;Road Bike&quot; print(f&quot;Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} &quot;) . Name: Mountain Bike, Gears: 11 . Popcorn Hacks #1: Add another print command to display the attributes of Bike #2. What output will this code segment produce? print(f&quot;Name: {bike2.name}, Gears: {bike2.gear} &quot;) . Name: Road Bike, Gears: 13 . Example: Defining a User Class . Now we will look into Classes for users of a program or website. . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . For this cell, we define a User class with a constructor method &quot;init&quot; that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . For backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Now let&#39;s make a new User: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: jeffrey, Email: leejeffreysc@gmail.com . Here&#39;s a step-by-step breakdown of how the code relates to backend functionality: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;): This line creates a new User object, initializing it with the username &quot;jeffrey&quot; and the email &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;. This could represent a user who has just signed up for an account, and the input values would typically come from user input, such as a frontend signup form. . new_user.display_info(): This line calls the display_info method on the new_user object, which prints the user&#39;s information (username and email) to the console. In a real-world backend application, you might use this method or a similar one to display user information in logs, send a welcome email, or create an API response with the user&#39;s data. . User/Class @ Decorators: . A Python Class allows for the use of @ decorators, these allow access to attribute data without the use of functions. . @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to &quot;GET&quot; attribute data in a clean method (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to &quot;UPDATE&quot;/set attribute data in a clean method (object.name = &quot;Jeffrey&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;Jeffrey&quot;)) | . The getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . class Student: def __init__(self, student, name): self._student = student self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Student class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . Usage of the getter and setter methods are below: . student = Student(1001, &quot;Derek Sol&quot;) print(student.name) # Get the name using the getter method student.name = &quot;Jagger Klein&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(student.name) . Derek Sol Jagger Klein . Popcorn Hacks #2: The following code segment for computers does not have getter and setter methods called. Using the missing attributes &quot;model&quot; and &quot;year&quot;, add example getter and setters methods for this class. Show us an example output that this code segment might produce. class Computer: def __init__(self, model, year): self._model = model self._year = year @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . laptop1 = Computer(&quot;Macbook Pro M2 Chip&quot;, &quot;2023&quot;) print(laptop1.model) # Get the name using the getter method print(laptop1.year) # Get the year using the getter method laptop2 = Computer(&quot;Lenovo i5 Pro&quot;, &quot;2022&quot;) print(laptop2.model) # Get the name using the getter method print(laptop2.year) # Get the year using the getter method . Macbook Pro M2 Chip 2023 Lenovo i5 Pro 2022 . Databases and SQLite . A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of that data. In other words, a database is a software application that allows you to store and manage large amounts of data in an organized manner. . Some Examples of Databases: . Storing and managing customer data, such as contact information, order history, and customer preferences. | Keeping track of inventory levels and stock movements in a warehouse or retail store. | Managing financial transactions, such as payments, invoices, and receipts. | . SQLite is a software library that provides a user-friendly database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is programmed within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite great for web applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t need a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, a Python web framework. Flask allows programmers to easily interact with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, grade INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Note: This will create a new file &#39;database.db&#39; in the _notebooks folder if one doesn&#39;t exist. . Breaking down this code segment: . We imported the necessary libraries and tools | We created a Flask application | We connected to the SQLite database using SQLite3 | We created a cursor object to execute SQL commands | We created tables in the database using SQL commands | . Flask provides several extensions and tools for working with SQLite databases, including Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLite3, and Flask-Admin. These tools provide a high-level interface for interacting with the database, making it easy to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records. . CRUD Commands with SQLite . CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations you can perform on data. SQL is useful library because it allows programmers to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command. . | . Example of CRUD within an SQLite Database . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE basketball (_player TEXT PRIMARY KEY, _team TEXT, _position TEXT, _opinion TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . OperationalError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[31], line 15 12 cursor = conn.cursor() 14 # Create a table in the database using SQL commands &gt; 15 cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE basketball 16 (_player TEXT PRIMARY KEY, _team TEXT, _position TEXT, _opinion TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) 18 # Commit the changes to the database 19 conn.commit() OperationalError: table basketball already exists . Hypothetically, our programmer wanted to create an application about basketball players, and created a new table in SQL to store and interact with user-submitted data. Using the same method as the previous table, a new table &#39;basketball&#39; is created by the cursor and added to the &#39;database.db&#39; file. . Create Function: . def create(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter the player name&quot;) team = input(&quot;Enter team name&quot;) position = input(&quot;Enter player position&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter your opinion &quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record in to db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO basketball (_player, _team, _position, _opinion) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (player, team, position, opinion)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;New basketball with {player} is added.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . New basketball with Kobe is added. . The create() feature allows users to input information about a basketball player and store it in a SQLite table &#39;basketball&#39; inside the database file we already created &#39;database.db&#39;. The code prompts the user for the player&#39;s name, team name, position, and their opinion about the player, then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . The cursor.execute() method is called with an SQL INSERT command to insert a new entry into the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The connection.commit() method saves the changes to the database, and if the record is inserted successfully, a confirmation message is printed. In case of errors, the except block catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints an error message. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the create() function is called to execute the code. . Read Function: . def read(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all the records from basketball table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM basketball&#39;).fetchall() if len(results) != 0: for row in results: print(row) else: print(&quot;No player found.&quot;) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() read() . (&#39;Kobe&#39;, &#39;Lankers&#39;, &#39;PG&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;) . The read() feature retrieves and prints all entries from the &#39;basketball&#39; table in the specified SQLite database. The script establishes a connection to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands, and calls the cursor.execute() method with an SQL SELECT command to fetch all the entires from the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The fetchall() method retrieves all the rows returned by the SELECT command and stores them in the results variable. . The code then checks if there are any records in the table and, if so, iterates through each row in the results using a &#39;for loop&#39; and prints the row. If there are no records, the program prints &quot;No player found&quot;. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the read() function is called to execute the code. . Update Function: . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter a basketball player to update the opinion for:&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter new opinion:&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Updating review for the basketball cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE basketball SET _opinion = ? WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (opinion, player)) if cursor.rowcount != 0: print(f&quot;Review for the basketball is updated to {opinion}&quot;) connection.commit() else: print(f&quot;Player not found.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update() . This update feature updates the opinion for a specific basketball player in an SQLite database. The code defines an update() function, which prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to update and the new opinion for that player. The script connects to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object, and handles any potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method updates the review in the database for the specified basketball item. . If at least one value is changed, a success message is printed and the changes are committed to the database. Otherwise, a &quot;Player not found.&quot; message is displayed. In the except block, if an error occurs, an error message along with specific error details is printed. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the update() function is called to execute the review update process. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter basketball player to delete&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM basketball WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (player,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: print(f&quot;{player} does not exist&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Successfully deleted basketball player {player}&quot;) connection.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred: &quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . does not exist . The delete feature deletes a specific basketball player from the specified SQLite database. The code defines a delete() function that prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to delete. After connecting to the SQLite database and creating a cursor object, the code handles potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method is used to delete the basketball item with the specified ID. . If no rows are affected, a message is printed indicating that the basketball player does not exist. Otherwise, a success message is displayed, confirming the basketball player&#39;s deletion. The changes are then committed to the database. In the except block, any error that occurs triggers an error message along with specific error details. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the delete() function is called to execute the basketball item deletion process. This code showcases a practical way to remove information from an SQLite database based on user input. . Menu Functions: . Alongside the four CRUD functions, a menu function is designed to manage Create, Read, Update, Delete operations and display the schema. The menu function is responsible for taking in user inputs and making the program call various functions. When running a menu function, users enter their desired operation, whether it be Create, Read, Update, or Delete, and the input is checked by various conditions to determine which function should be called. Many menu functions are called recursively, so the cell will repeat the menu process until the user decides to exit. . Popcorn Hacks #3: The menu function below is missing some of the CRUD functions for the specified basketball players table. Fix the following code by adding the intended CRUD functions, then perform a READ function on the database. def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . (&#39;Kobe&#39;, &#39;Lankers&#39;, &#39;PG&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;) . Image Uploading with SQLite . Using various Python Libraries, we are able to upload and customize images using python code, as well as using images to interact with databases. . One way to store images in a database is to INSERT the image data as a binary blob. . To store an image as a blob in SQLite, you can first read the image file and convert it to a binary format using a programming language like Python. Here&#39;s an example of how to do this: . Making the Table to store our Image Data: . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE image (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . We use a new data type &quot;BLOB&quot; to store specific data from our .jpg image. . Adding Image Data to our Table: . You can use this example sunset jpg for our code. Download and place it in the same repository as this notebook. Rename image to &#39;image.jpg&#39; . https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/04/78/75/360_F_104787586_63vz1PkylLEfSfZ08dqTnqJqlqdq0eXx.jpg . import sqlite3 # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;image.jpeg&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as jpg: image_data = jpg.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . In this example, the image data is read from the &quot;image.jpg&quot; file and inserted into the &quot;images&quot; table in the &quot;database.db&quot; SQLite database. The image data is then stored as a binary blob in the &quot;data&quot; column of the table. . Converting BLOB to Image -&gt; Displaying Image . import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() . The image data is then retrieved from the &quot;images&quot; table using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that correctly matches the image name. The binary image data is then converted to an image object using the PIL library and displayed on the screen. . Popcorn Hacks #4: Using the same table, find a new .jpg image and add its image data to the database. Display the image using the PIL Library and show us the output image. import sqlite3 # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;newImage.png&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as jpg: image_data = jpg.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;image2&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . IntegrityError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[44], line 12 9 image_data = jpg.read() 11 # Insert the image data into the database &gt; 12 conn.execute(&#34;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&#34;, (&#39;image2&#39;, image_data)) 14 # Commit the transaction 15 conn.commit() IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: images.name .

Anaconda is like a big tool box for your computer, it has tools and libraries that you might need for data analysis, programming, and computing. Anaconda Python packages include pandas, numpy, sqlite, jupyter, bash, and other kernels. Conda is a tool that helps you manage these tools inside Anaconda. It lets you install, update, delete, and organize packages and materials. Conda script tells Conda what tools and materials you need and how to install them in your Anaconda toolbox. . . Type these commands in powershell or terminal . PS C: Users UserName&gt; wsl # Windows prompt to WSL command $ cd /tmp # used to store temporary files $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-Linux-x86_64.sh # downloadable file $ chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # chmod (change mode command) changes permissions for a file or directory # Answer yes to all the prompts $ ./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh . Start a new WSL Command or Powershell. Now the WSL prompt should be prefixed with (base) from Anaconda install. If not, go back to Anaconda install. The base prefix indicates that you are running inside the conda/anaconda environment. The command &quot;conda deactivate&quot; should bring you back. . PS C: Users ShayM&gt; wsl # Windows prompt (base) shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ cd ~ # WSL prompt (base) shay@MSI:~$ # WSL home, best place to install files # you can check your conda versions (base) id:~$ conda --version . .

Hacks: Screen shot that you have conda installed | . Setting up GitHub Pages with FastPages Features . All of you have created your own repository before at the beginning of the year, but some things have changed in the process. . Duplicate APCSP, and use it as template for your own repo | . Name your repo and include all branches before clicking the green create button. | . If you have an automatically generated pull request, then go ahead and follow the instructions on there. If there is no pull request, as shown below, then move on to step 4. | . Navigate to this link. Select: RSA and 4096 and leave Passphrase blank. Click the blue button Generate-SSH-Keys. You have just created an ssh key-pair. | . Navigate to this link. Replace the section of the link &quot;yourrepositoryname&quot; with your repository name. In the picture, I have inputted “ourshiny,” because it is my repository name. Replace the section of the link &quot;yourgithubname&quot; with your repository name that you just made. https://github.com/yourgithubname/yourrepositoryname/settings/secrets/actions | . Click New repository secret. Copy and paste the Private Key (generated in step 4) into the Value field. This includes the &quot;BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY&quot; and &quot;--END RSA PRIVATE KEY&quot; portions. In the Name field, name the secret SSH_DEPLOY_KEY. Once done, click the green Add Secret button. | . Navigate to this link, then replace the portions below with your github and repository names. My github name in the image below is jiya-sav, and my repository name is ourshiny. https://github.com/yourgithubname/yourrepositoryname/settings/keys | . Click the Add deploy key button. Paste your Public Key (generated in step 4) into the Key box. In the Title, name the key anything you want, for example fastpages-key. Finally, make sure you click the checkbox next to Allow write access (pictured below), and click the green Add key button to save the key. | . . GitHub Actions will build your site, which will take 2-3 minutes to complete. This will happen anytime you push changes to the master branch of your repository. You can monitor the logs of this if you like on the Actions tab of your repo. Your GH-Pages Status badge on your README will eventually appear and be green, indicating your first successful build. You can monitor the status of your site in the GitHub Pages section of your repository settings. | Now that you have made your repository secure, you can clone it into vscode and CODE, CODE, CODE!!! . How to Make a Pull Request . After you&#39;ve cloned a repository and made changes to it, go to pull requests in your Github repository . | Once you click &#39;create new pull request,&#39; you should see this with your new changes: . | Change the title and send the pull request . | Hacks: You will be turning in all your hacks as a pull request. Title the pull request as shown in the third step but with your own name. Any other titles will not be accepted. | . Fetching . The Basics . Fetching means getting data from somewhere else, like a website or database. | . JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to fetch data from a website or database. . When you fetch data with JavaScript, you first need to tell it where to get the data from. This is called the URL. | Once you know the URL, you can use JavaScript to go and get the data from that URL. | When the data comes back, it&#39;s usually in a format like text or JSON. This means that you might need to do some additional work to turn the data into something that your website or application can use. | Once you have the data, you can use JavaScript to display it on your website or application. You can put it in a table, show it on a map, or do anything else you can think of. | . . About Fetching . Method . The fetching methods are in line with the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and list as follows: . &quot;GET&quot;: Probably the most common method you would use, which is in line with &quot;read&quot;. It essentially &quot;gets&quot; the information from the API and brings it to the frontend where you are able to display it and read it. | &quot;POST&quot;: Lines up with &quot;create&quot; and adds a resource to the API. You will probably mostly be using this with your own API or if a website adds your input to an API. | &quot;PUT&quot; and &quot;PATCH&quot;: Essentially the &quot;update&quot; for API. Use &quot;PUT&quot; if you want to change the whole resource, or &quot;PATCH&quot; if you want to change just one part of a resource. | &quot;DELETE&quot;: Exactly how it sounds, deletes a resource from the API | . Popcorn Hacks: . What method should I use if I want to display some of the data stored in the backend? | . GET . What method would I use if something in the data is misspelled and I want to fix it real quick? | . PUT . What method should I use if I want to add a new entry to the data? | . POST . Filtering Data . If we want to display API data, we are going to have to filter what we want to display for multiple reasons These include making sure that the user only sees information they need to see, and not anything else | Also we need to present the information in a readable format instead of just seeing the raw data | . | . The below code segment, is from a previous project. It shows the use of a url being fetched, and the JavaScript fetch() command being implemented. . // prepare fetch urls // const url = &quot;https://ssjn.nighthawkcodescrums.gq/api/song&quot;; const url = &quot;https://ssjncpt.duckdns.org/api/song&quot;; const sad_url = url + &quot;/sad/&quot;; // sad category const happy_url = url + &quot;/happy/&quot;; // happy category const rage_url = url + &quot;/rage/&quot;; // rage category const indian_url = url + &quot;/indian/&quot;; // indian category // prepare fetch GET options const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; // &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;, }, }; // prepare fetch PUT options, clones with JS Spread Operator (...) const put_options = {...options, method: &#39;PUT&#39;}; // clones and replaces method // fetch the API fetch(url, options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { error(&#39;GET API response failure: &#39; + response.status); return; } // valid response will have JSON data . Third Party APIs . APIs provided by other developers for public use. . | Programmers can use the content of these APIs to create new functionalities for their programs, or they can also simply take advantage of the data of the API for different uses. . Ex: A developed can use Google Account login to allow users to log in with their google account . | Ex: Using the content of a weather API to make a weather app . | . | The functionalities of these APIs are usually accessed via JavaScript (usually) as you’ve seen before in your past projects. . | 3rd party APIs are located on third party servers. To access them from JavaScript you first need to connect to the API functionality and make it available on your page. . | . &lt;script src=&quot;https://api.mqcdn.com/sdk/mapquest-js/v1.3.2/mapquest.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://api.mqcdn.com/sdk/mapquest-js/v1.3.2/mapquest.css&quot; /&gt; . Here is an example of accessing the objects available in the library above. | . const map = L.mapquest.map(&#39;map&#39;, { center: [53.480759, -2.242631], layers: L.mapquest.tileLayer(&#39;map&#39;), zoom: 12 }); . The process of accessing and using third-party APIs can vary depending on the specific API and the requirements set by the API provider. 3rd party APIs use developer keys to allow developers access to the API functionality, which protects the owner of the API. | . L.mapquest.key = &#39;YOUR-API-KEY-HERE&#39;; . Developers must apply to get the key of a certain API, and then include it in their code to be allowed access to the API&#39;s functionality. Some API keys are accessed slightly differently, but the method is similar for the most part. | . Put the link of a 3rd party API you have or will use below? . Weather App Project: https://github.com/dolphinalt/Weather-App . API url: https://visual-crossing-weather.p.rapidapi.com/forecast . Pandas . While 3rd party APIs give you access to a plethora of data you may have not been able to include using a completely new self-made database, pandas can help you organize and utlize this data. . Pandas is an open-source library that allows for the manipulation and analysis of numerical data, which is vital in real-life applications. . We have used this in the song recommendation program we are currently developing. The use of pandas allows us to take the csv file we obtained from a third party and display it in a format we can manipulate and analyze. . import os import pandas as pd from flask import render_template @app.route(&#39;/songdata&#39;) def songdata(): # Path to the CSV file csv_path = os.path.join(app.static_folder, &#39;songdata.csv&#39;) # Read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # Render the dataframe as an HTML table using Jinja2 return render_template(&#39;songdata.html&#39;, table=df.to_html(index=False)) . This is how the dataframe will appear on our flask: . . Python (Request) Fetch . Example with Weather API .

Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes | Compare simulations with real-world contexts. | Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena. | What are simulations by College Board definition? . Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the constraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of hypothesis under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . . Analyzing an Example: Air-Traffic Simulator . Say we want to find out what the optimal number of aircrafts that can be in the air in one area is. | A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety Unfortunately we can&#39;t just fly 67 planes all at once and see what happens | . | Since the simulation won&#39;t be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer | Will not always have the same result | . Functions we often need (python) . import random # a module that defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers random.choice() #returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence random.choice(mylist) # returns random value from list random.randint(0,10) #randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 random.random() #will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. . Functions we often need (js) . Math.random(); // returns a random number Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // Returns a random integer from 0 to 9: . College Board Question 1 . Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 foodPerDay ← 20 foodLeft ← 160 daysStarving ← 0 REPEAT 5 TIMES { foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } .

Here we initialize the total population to be 50, then set the growth factor as 1.00005 (.005 percent change). It will print the population every 56th day until it reaches one million. It multiplies the current population by the growth factor in each iteration, and increments the day count. When the day count reaches 56, it prints the current population and resets the day count to 0. . Note! This simulation assumes that the growth factor remains constant as time progresses, which may not be a realistic assumption in real-world scenarios. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Define the initial population and growth rate population = 100 growth_rate = 0.05 # Define the number of years to simulate num_years = 50 # Create lists to store the population and year values populations = [population] years = [0] # Simulate population growth for the specified number of years for year in range(1, num_years+1): # Calculate the new population size new_population = population + (growth_rate * population) # Update the population and year lists populations.append(new_population) years.append(year) # Set the new population as the current population for the next iteration population = new_population # Plot the population growth over time plt.plot(years, populations) plt.xlabel(&#39;Year&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Population&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Population Growth Simulation&#39;) plt.show() .

Learning Objectives . DAT-1.A: Representing Data with Bits . Basic Information . Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1. A byte is 8 bits. | . | Sequences of bits are used to represent different things. Representing data with sequences of bits is called Abstraction. | . | . Practice Questions: . How many bits are in 3 bytes? | 24 bits . What digital information can be represented by bits? | Numbers, Text, Colors, Images, etc. . Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two? | Bits are a digital form of storing data, as the bits are virtualized. Analog forms of storing data are physical, such as a CD or a DVD. . Examples . Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary. 0 = False | 1 = True | . | . import random def example(runs): # Repeat code for the amount of runs given while runs &gt; 0: # Assigns variable boolean to either True or False based on random binary number 0 or 1. boolean = False if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else True # If the number was 1 (True), it prints &quot;awesome.&quot; if boolean: print(&quot;binary is awesome&quot;) # If the number was 2 (False), it prints &quot;cool.&quot; else: print(&quot;binary is cool&quot;) runs -= 1 # Change the parameter to how many times to run the function. example(10) . binary is awesome binary is cool binary is awesome binary is awesome binary is awesome binary is cool binary is cool binary is awesome binary is cool binary is cool . DAT-1.B: The Consequences of Using Bits to Represent Data . Basic Information . Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in __ or other errors. | Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory. | Fixed number of bits are used to represent real numbers/limits | . Practice Questions: . What is the largest number can be represented by 5 bits? | 1+2+4+8+16 = 31 (2^5 - 1) . One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language? | 2^56 / 2^16 = 2^40 . 5 bits are used to represent both positive and negative numbers, what is the largest number that can be represented by these bits? (hint: different than question 1) | 15, because when you represent negative numbers, the first bit represents the sign, meaning there are 4 usable bits. 2^4 - 1 = 15. . Examples . import math def exponent(base, power): # Print the operation performed, turning the parameters into strings to properly concatenate with the symbols &quot;^&quot; and &quot;=&quot;. print(str(base) + &quot;^&quot; + str(power) + &quot; = &quot; + str(math.pow(base, power))) # How can function become a problem? (Hint: what happens if you set both base and power equal to high numbers?) exponent(5, 2) . 5^2 = 25.0 . DAT-1.C: Binary Math . Basic Information . Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1. | Decimal is Base 10, meaning eacht digit can represent values from 0 to 9. | Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions. | . Practice Questions: . What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent? | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This is because the Base word means each base (or integer) can hold N values, in this case, 5. . What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent? | Hexadecimal is base 16. Each digit can represent values from 0 to 9, and A to F. . When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system? | N would represent the Base 10 number 10 in a Base 30 system. In a Base 50 system, the letter would still be M, as the ways that you would represent numbers past 9 are the same in all bases. . Examples . Using 6 bits, we can represent 64 numbers, from 0 to 63, as 2^6 = 64. | The numbers in a sequence of binary go from right to left, increasing by powers of two from 0 to the total amount of bits. The whole number represented is the sum of these bits. For example: 111111 | 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 | 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 | 63 | | Fill in the blanks (convert to decimal) . 001010 = 10 | 11100010 = 226 | 10 = 2 | | Fill in the blanks (convert to binary) . 12 = 1100 | 35 = 100011 | 256 = 11111111 | | .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # 3 unique values are printed # 1, 2, and 3 # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Hashmaps and hashtables can only have unique values, and having a set will eliminate these repeat values . {1, 2, 3} .

(C) The ability to resolve errors in domain name system (DNS) lookups . (D) The ability to use multiple protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), Internet protocol (IP), and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) to transfer data . My answer: D . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing. . Q17: . A large data set contains information about all students majoring in computer science in colleges across the United States. The data set contains the following information about each student. . The student’s gender . The state in which the student attends college . The student’s grade point average on a 4.0 scale . Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set? . (A) Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects? . (B) How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state? . (C) What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science? . (D) Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science? . My answer: C . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because the data set stores information about an individual student’s gender and state. This information can be aggregated to extract information about the percentage of female majors in each state. . Q19: . A retailer that sells footwear maintains a single database containing records with the following information about each item for sale in the retailer’s store. . Item identification number . | Footwear type (sneakers, boots, sandals, etc.) . | Selling price (in dollars) . | Size . | Color . | Quantity available . | . Using only the database, which of the following can be determined? . (A) Which items listed in the database are not currently in the store . (B) Which colors are more popular among men than women . (C) Which type of footwear is most popular among adults . (D) The total number of shoes sold in a particular month . My answer: D . Correct answer: A . The correct answer is A because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available, the retailer can search for all item identification numbers that have a quantity of 0. . Q20: . When a cellular telephone user places a call, the carrier transmits the caller’s voice as well as the voice of the person who is called. The encoded voices are the data of the call. In addition to transmitting the data, the carrier also stores metadata. The metadata of the call include information such as the time the call is placed and the phone numbers of both participants. For which of the following goals would it be more useful to computationally analyze the metadata instead of the data? . I. To determine if a caller frequently uses a specific word . II. To estimate the number of phone calls that will be placed next Monday between 10:30 A.M. and noon. . III. To generate a list of criminal suspects when given the telephone number of a known criminal . (A) I only . (B) II only . (C) II and III only . (D) I, II, and III . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because both II and III are correct choices. II is correct because the repository of stored metadata includes time, so information about the time of calls can be analyzed to make predictions about future calls. In addition, III is correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers of the two parties of a call. Given one phone number, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person. . Q27: . Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case. . Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image? . (A) Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality. . (B) Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black. . (C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed. . (D) Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture. . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because if a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored. . Q28: . A video-streaming Web site uses 32-bit integers to count the number of times each video has been played. In anticipation of some videos being played more times than can be represented with 32 bits, the Web site is planning to change to 64-bit integers for the counter. Which of the following best describes the result of using 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers? . (A) 2 times as many values can be represented. . (B) 32 times as many values can be represented. . (C) 232 times as many values can be represented. . (D) 322 times as many values can be represented. . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because when you go from 32 bits to 64 bits you are increacing by a factor of 32, therefore 2^32 means 232 times as many values can be represented. . Q29: . An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences? . (A) 2 more items can be uniquely identified. . (B) 10 more items can be uniquely identified. . (C) 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified. . (D) 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified. . My answer: B . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because Using 6-bit binary sequences allows for 26 or 64 different items to be identified. Using 7-bit binary sequences allows for 27 or 128 different items to be identified. Thus there are two times as many items that can be uniquely identified. . Q30: . Each student that enrolls at a school is assigned a unique ID number, which is stored as a binary number. The ID numbers increase sequentially by 1 with each newly enrolled student. If the ID number assigned to the last student who enrolled was the binary number 1001 0011, what binary number will be assigned to the next student who enrolls? . (A) 1001 0100 . (B) 1001 0111 . (C) 1101 0100 . (D) 1101 0111 . My answer: C . Correct answer: A . The correct answer is A because when you add one, you need to shift every bit over by 1, 1001 0100 is the correct answer. . Q36: . For which of the following situations would it be best to use a heuristic in order to find a solution that runs in a reasonable amount of time? . (A) Appending a value to a list of n elements, which requires no list elements be examined. . (B) Finding the fastest route that visits every location among n locations, which requires n! possible routes be examined. . (C) Performing a binary search for a score in a sorted list of n scores, which requires that fewer than n scores be examined. . (D) Performing a linear search for a name in an unsorted database of n people, which requires that up to n entries be examined. . My answer: D . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because if an algorithm has a factorial efficiency, it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q37: . A graphic artist uses a program to draw geometric shapes in a given pattern. The program uses an algorithm that draws the shapes based on input from the artist. The table shows the approximate number of steps the algorithm takes to draw different numbers of shapes. . Number of Shapes Drawn Number of Steps . 4 | 17 | . 5 | 24 | . 6 | 35 | . 7 | 50 | . Based on the values in the table, which of the following best characterizes the algorithm for drawing n shapes, where n is a very large number? . (A) The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n steps to draw n shapes. . (B) The algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n2 steps to draw n shapes. . (C) The algorithm runs in an unreasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n steps to draw n shapes. . (D) The algorithm runs in an unreasonable amount of time because it will use approximately n2 steps to draw n shapes. . My answer: A . Correct answer: B . The correct answer is B because as n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n2, which would make the algorithm polynomial. An algorithm with an efficiency that approximates n2 is said to run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q41: . A student is writing a program that is intended to replace each negative value in a particular column of a spreadsheet with the value 0. Which of the following procedures is most likely to be useful in the student’s program? . (A) A procedure containsNegatives, which returns true if any negative values appear in the column and returns false otherwise. . (B) A procedure countNegatives, which returns the number of negative values that appear in the column. . (C) A procedure findNegative, which returns the row number of the first negative value that appears in the column or -1 if there are no negative values. . (D) A procedure minimum, which returns the minimum value that appears in the column. . My answer: A . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because using this procedure would allow the student to identify the location where a negative value occurs, and then change that value to 0. This process can continue with repeated calls to the procedure until there are no more negative values. . Q49: . A teacher stores the most recent quiz scores for her class in the list scores. The first element in the list holds the maximum possible number of points that can be awarded on the quiz, and each remaining element holds one student’s quiz score. Assume that scores contains at least two elements. Which of the following code segments will set the variable found to true if at least one student scored the maximum possible number of points on the quiz and will set found to false otherwise? . (A) . (B) . (C) . (D) . My answer: A . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because the code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. .",

A programmer is writing a program to implement the frequent customer program. In one code segment, cost is set to 0 for every 10th purchase by a given customer. The programmer will use the procedure One word, Get Count, open parenthesis, one word, customer I D, close parenthesis , which returns the total number of purchases a customer has made since enrolling in the frequent customer program, including his or her first purchase. . Which of the following code segments will set cost to 0 for every 10th purchase a customer makes after enrolling in the frequent customer program? . (A) . (B) . (C) . (D) . My answer: A . Correct answer: C . The correct answer is C because the expression count, MOD, 10 equals 0 evaluates to true when count is a multiple of 1 0, so this code segment sets cost to 0 under the appropriate conditions. . Q43: . Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case. . An online retailer uses an algorithm to sort a list of n items by price. The table below shows the approximate number of steps the algorithm takes to sort lists of different sizes. . Based on the values in the table, which of the following best characterizes the algorithm for very large values of n ? . (A) The algorithm runs in reasonable time. . (B) The algorithm runs, but not in reasonable time. . (C) The algorithm attempts to solve an undecidable problem. . (D) The algorithm attempts to find an approximate solution whenever it fails to find an exact solution. . My answer: B . Correct answer: A . The correct answer is A because the pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. . Q46: .

            "title": "Data Structures- Space and Time Complexity",
            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . The space and time complexity of an algorithm is important because it can affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it will take a long time to run if the input size is large, but an algorithm that has a time complexity of O(ln(n)) will run in a very short amount of time no matter the input size. Similarly, if an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it will require a lot of memory if the input size is large. | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk. The first code block is the original image.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . This is a space complexity problem because the amount of memory used by the algorithm is affected by the size of the input. The amount of memory used by the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input. | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Example of Matrix Multiplication . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . A visualization of calculating the fibonacci sequence . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) .

Notes . Now the code is adding new users to the database, and checking if there are duplicate users or if the there is a database error when trying to add a new user. . Check for given Credentials in users table in sqlite.db . Use of ORM Query object and custom methods to identify user to credentials uid and password . Comment on purpose of following User.query.filter_by | user.password | | . def find_by_uid(uid): with app.app_context(): user = User.query.filter_by(_uid=uid).first() return user # returns user object # Check credentials by finding user and verify password def check_credentials(uid, password): # query email and return user record user = find_by_uid(uid) if user == None: return False if (user.is_password(password)): return True return False #check_credentials(&quot;indi&quot;, &quot;123qwerty&quot;) . Notes . The code allows for searching within the database, including finding users by their uid or by credentials. Looking at the code, the check_credentials function could be very useful for login pages. . Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQLALchemy and custom user.create() method to add row. . Comment on purpose of following user.find_by_uid() and try/except | user = User(...) | user.dob and try/except | user.create() and try/except | | . def create(): # optimize user time to see if uid exists uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) user = find_by_uid(uid) try: print(&quot;Found n&quot;, user.read()) return except: pass # keep going # request value that ensure creating valid object name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) # Initialize User object before date user = User(name=name, uid=uid, password=password ) # create user.dob, fail with today as dob dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) try: user.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date() except ValueError: user.dob = datetime.today() print(f&quot;Invalid date {dob} require YYYY-mm-dd, date defaulted to {user.dob}&quot;) # write object to database with app.app_context(): try: object = user.create() print(&quot;Created n&quot;, object.read()) except: # error raised if object not created print(&quot;Unknown error uid {uid}&quot;) create() . Notes . The code allows for the checking of existing users through user input. If the user is found, then the code will allow for creating a date of birth. If not found, the code raises an error. . Reading users table in sqlite.db . Uses SQLALchemy query.all method to read data . Comment on purpose of following User.query.all | json_ready assignment, google List Comprehension | | . # SQLAlchemy extracts all users from database, turns each user into JSON def read(): with app.app_context(): table = User.query.all() json_ready = [user.read() for user in table] # &quot;List Comprehensions&quot;, for each user add user.read() to list return json_ready read() .

Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

My answer: C Correct answer: A An email address by its self won’t cause much harm, however, an email password would. The answer is A because cookies stored in the user’s Web browser can contain saved passwords, creditcard info, and more, all accessable without a password. . Q4 . My answer: D Correct answer: A The correct answer here is D, as having the data in a database will only need to more data stored, increacing the need for data compression. However, having all the data in a singular database allows for easy analysis of the data within calling sessions, and make updates and decisions based on the data. . Q7 . My answer: C Correct answer: A Of the three answer choices, only I was not needed by the original system, as there was no need for the customer to verbally disclose what they wanted to pick, all they needed was to select a number on a keypad. However, a call into the system is still nesscary, therefore choice III was needed. . Q29 . My answer: D Correct answer: B The correct answer here was B, because in step 4, a is being assigned the value of NOT (a OR b) AND c. a was assigned with true in step one, b assigned with false and c assigned with true. Therefore, NOT (a OR b) is the opposite of a or b, which is the opposite of true, being false. false AND c is false, therefore a is assigned with false. Taking this value of a equaling false and doing c AND a results in false AND false, which is false. Therefore, the correct answer is B. . Q49 . My answer: D Correct answer: B Simulations will lack important details. Wether it is because of the programers forgeting a detail or an unexpected detail pops up, simulations will not be able to account for every detail, and may omit details to make it easier to implement. .",

It was a great experience, and I also got many inspirations for future projects, such as projects in which users can review items or locations from many other users, in a fassiopn similar to something like yelp.

The way the artists use different means or designs to express their emotions and feelings is amazing, and I was very inspired by the works of art that I saw. I also learned that I should try to be more creative in my own art, and try to express my own feelings and emotions through my art, rather than just making art for the sake of making art. . . . . . .",

Q16 (4) . The answer choice I picked (B) is wrong because searching will only be looking through the list whereas the correct answer choice (C) is correct because selecting will be selecting different values to be added together. . Q45 (4) . The answer choice I picked (A) is wrong because a heuristic approach means to approximate a solution. This is used in cases where the problem cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time by an algorithm, therefore an approximation is required. This is why the correct answer choice (C) is correct. . Q47 (4) . The answer choice I picked (D) is wrong in most cases, as sorting a list of numbers can be done with a precise answer and in a reasonable amount of time. The correct answer choice is (C) because a program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations cannot be found in a reasonable amount of time, as there are an infinite amount of routes. However, an approximate solution is acceptable here, as it will not have a large impact. . Q49 (4) . The answer choice I picked (B) is wrong, because there are some problems that computers cannot solve, even given an algorithm and an infinite amount of time.

Secondly, it allows for much faster cracking of passwords, stealing of data, and many more issues. | Allows for faster rendering, more processing power, solving of problems that otherwise couldn’t be solved | Large power draw, efficient password cracking, exploiting of servers and services | . Ad Blockers | Overview Benefits Harms . Add blockers are used to block unwanted ads from websites. However useful this may be, there are a few obvious flaws. Some include that small companies will lose money from this, as their source of income (ads) are completely blocked. | Allows for more focus on work and projects etc, as there are no ads distracting you. | Loss of a significant portion of income for companies. | . Tik Tok - Dopamine issue | Overview Benefits Harms . Tik Tok is hard wired to deliver as much Dopamine as possible, in the shortest amount of time possible. This results in loss of attention for the user when doing everyday tasks. As the app conditions their brain on an constant overload and influx in information and entertainment, when doing a task that does not have this same information overload, the user will experience severe boredom and a lack of stimulation. | Provides entertainment for the user, relieves stress, etc. | Results in a loss of attention when doing mundane tasks | . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? . The best way to empower yourself in a digital world is steer clear from things that may harm self confidence, or may put you in danger. For example, try not to spend too much time on the toxic environment of social media. Another thing is to try and stay away from talking about specifics online, such as your age, name, gender, and many more. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping them to learn about the dangers of internet, how to secure themselves from outside threats. You can also guide them about basic internet etiquette that way they don’t become the bullier, as well as the victim. At del norte, there are already many clubs relating to this topic, such as cybersecurity clubs, CyberAegis, and many more. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Yes, the idea that the only way to prevent the negative effects of internet is to stay off of it as well as the idea that social media is always bad are some types of red tapes blocking digital empowerment. These barriers are shown at Del Norte, as shown with the extremely restrictive access to parts of the windows pcs at school, where in reality it would be a good idea to allow students to be exposed to these security options. Elsewhere, many parents are under the impression that all social media is bad, however, if you learn to use social media properly, it isn’t always bad. . Project Approval .

Pros Cons . Prevents inexperienced students from messing with sensitive settings | The people who don’t know about advanced settings will never know, while the people who do feel restricted | . Prevents students from visiting inappropriate sites or getting distracted by games | Many websites that may be useful are also blocked, such as independent blogs that may have valuable information | . Creates a overall more focused environment | Creates a confined environment | . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . Some concerns I have for the digital divide is the restriction of opportunities for people without good laptops. I personally have a decently powerful laptop at home, however, for others this may not be true. Some people may not have a powerful enough laptop to, for example, run video editing programs. This prevents them from attending digital media classes, completely restricting them from going down a path that may have been very appealing to them. Another example is practicing red teaming or ethical hacking. As it is the best practice to run all pen testing software and exploits on a virtual machine, some laptops may not support this virtualization or may not have the power to run a machine with enough power to support a heavy virtual machine running on top of the host os. .",

Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . Some PII I have seen on projects in APCSP include calculating of grades (asking for your grade, GPA, classes, etc.) sharing of school schedules (asking for your classes, teachers, etc.) and sharing of personal information (asking for your name and grade). . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . My feelings about PII are that some PII may be beneficial, while some may be harmful. For example, ways that PII may be beneficial include things such as linkedin, where you can be recognized for your skills and accomplishments. However, PII can be harmful if used for malicious purposes or if it isn’t kept securely. This can include leaked passwords, credentials, and these can be leveraged for malicious gain. In my personal exposure, I have a linkedin, therefore my PII is already on the internet. Not only this, but my school profile has a lot of PII, which may be at risk for leaks. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Good passwords are passwords that are hard to brute force, have a secure amount of characters, and are not easily guessed. Bad passwords are the opposite, having a small amount of characters, being easy to guess, and being easy to brute force. Some examples of good and bad passwords are “password” and “password123” being bad, and “password123!” and “password123!@#” being good. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is the use of two-factor authentication. This is where the user must provide two pieces of information to authenticate, such as a password and a code sent to their phone. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . Symmetric encryption is where the encryption is reversible, and the encryption method is hte same as the decryption method. An example of symmetric encryption are DES, Triple DES and AES. Asymmetric encryption is where the encryption method is not the same as the decryption method. This is especially useful in authentication. Some examples of asymmetric encryption are pubkey authentication, RSA, and the Diffe-Hellman exchange method. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . An example of encryption we used in AWS deployment is the SSH public key authentication. This is a type of asymmetric encryption where the message is encrypted by the private key and must be decrypted by the public key. Without the matching public key for the corresponding private key, there is no way to decrypt the message. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . I have fallen for a phishing scheme when I was in elementary school. There was a popup for a page that I was on that had told me that I had many viruses on my machine, and being naive, I clicked on the link. It took me to a page that looked like a Windows update page, and it asked me to download a program to remove the viruses. I downloaded the program, and it ended up being a virus. We weren’t able to remove the virus, and we had to reinstall Windows. Some other phishing techniques can include fake emails, fake websites, and fake phone calls. .",

            "content": "Big Idea 5.3 Computing Bias . From the activities, I gathered a lot of important information regarding the state of bias within computing and computer programs. Wether it is the bias for more news within Facebook favored for the older generation, or the content within Tiktok favored for the younger generation, biases in which content or information is served to you vary greatly. In addition, some biases may be such as the example with the facial recognition software, not being able to recognize some skin tones better than others. This may be due to the developers not using enough testing information, or having a flawed algorithm. This can be fixed using crowdsourcing . Big Idea 5.4 Crowdsourcing . Our entire project is based off of crowdsourcing, as we are collecting information from users for every part of our project. For logging in and signing up we are retrieving the users full names, MySchedules will be collecting user schedules, MyClasses will be getting user reviews of classes, and MyGPA (being the best example) collects user GPAs and compares them to all the other collected GPAs and calculates different statistics. To achieve our Crowdsourcing goals, we could ask every student in APCSP to sign up for or program and fill out all the different applications according to their own schedules, GPA, or class reviews. .",

Row Score Explaintation Notes/Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input, functionality, and output of the program, which had the user input a state and then select different pieces of information to display on the screen. Moreover, the written response also clear documented the purpose (function) of the program was to provide the user with information on a us state, and that the actual purpose was to help with memorization and to learn new things. | | . Data Abstraction | 0/1 | The program and response does include the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (statelist), and the purpose it serves. However, it does not show how the data is stored within the list. As such, it does not earn the point for this row of the rubric. Moreover, the description in the written response for the list was also inaccurate as the list statelist only represents the name of the states. | &lt;/tr&gt; Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response does an good job at stating how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to code each peice of data independently from each other, resulting in greater code complexity. | Collegeboard says that the written response does not go a good job of explaining in detail on how the operation would be more complex to store. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0/1 | Although the written reponse demonstrates the usage of a function updatescreen in order to assign an index to each state. This function does not contain any parameters that are passed to it. Thus the program does not earn the point in this row. | Collegeboard decided that the written response also inaccurately described the main function of the procedure | . Algorithm Implementation | 0/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of many if statements to implement sequencing and selection. However, the program does not indicate the use of any form of a loop or anything similar to denote a use of iteration in the program. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response shows the results and scenario of the both proceudres to identify that their program works as expected according to the set purpose and function | The written reponse does not properly show different parameters that are plugged into the procedures. Additionally, it does not describe the result in detail, instead, it only gives a breif overview of what happens on screen instead. | . &lt;/table&gt; ### **Submission 4** Row Score Explaintation Notes/Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input and output of the program, which was to use certain keyboard keys such as a and d to move the boat, and eventually add to a total count of fish if the hook comes into contact with a fish. THe function and purpose were also stated explicity, with the purpose being to reduce boredom, and the function being to simulate a fishing game. | | . Data Abstraction | 1/1 | The program and response does include the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (fishtypes), and the purpose it serves. The list is in the form of an array that stores the total amount of fish caught by the user. Later, the list is also shown to be used to output the total number of fish of each type caught. | | . Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response does an good job at stating how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to resort to the use of individual variables to store each fish and the number of that fish caught, which would not only be cumbersome and produce clutter, but would also be hard to add new fish types in the future. The student also address and refutes the possibility of using individual variables for each type of fish and it&#39;s total. | | . Procedural Abstraction | 1/1 | The written reponse demonstrates usage of a function clone movement in order to determine the spawning of the fishes including their location, distance, and final position. This function consists of 5 arguments serving to define the range and speed of the fish. The student also explains how this specific helps the functionality of the program as a whole, as it serves to randomly spawn fishes with different attributes to increase the difficulty of the game. | | . Algorithm Implementation | 1/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of a loop to implement iteration to move the fish clone until it eithe reaches the end of the screen, or is touched by the hook. Sequencing could also be observed in the function as it creates a clone of a fish first before executing the loop and it&#39;s following logic. Moreover, the algorithm also uses an if statement to implement selection in the code to determine whether of not if the clone is touching the edge of the screen. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response clearly shows the inputting of two different inputs, one where the clone is touching the right edge of the screen, and another one where it doesn&#39;t. Moreover, the response clearly details the results of each procedure. The end results of the program are also the expected results. | According to collegeboard, this student did not earn the point for this row because they only tested for the alternate code segments, rather than actual arguments, parameters, and inputs into the function itself. | . ## Reflection: ### **on any discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring** I was consistantly grading much more leinently than college board did, might be because I am still not very familiar for every single one of the requirements to be met. ### **on what your program will need to fulfill all requirements** On my program, I need to make sure that I have detailed testing in order to fulfill all requirements for the performance task. ### **on the criteria and why a submission may have failed to meet the standard** The submissions that failed to meet the standerds failed due to them not being able to meet every single sub-requirement, while I was not checking each sub-requirement in very much detail. | .",

A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however. answer options: The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias | The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. | If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation. | The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output. | | . | Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why? answer options No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results. | No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment. | Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output. | Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences. | | . | Sylvia is an industrial engineer working for a sporting goods company.

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import os from random import randint import math as m . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() oogway.position(0.00,0.00) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) oogway.right(90) oogway.forward(50) . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | rounds up to the next integer | . floor(x) | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | Runs the factorial function | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * num1 = input() num1 = int(num1) num2 = input() num2 = int(num2) print(ceil(num1)) print(ceil(num2)) print(floor(num1)) print(floor(num2)) print(lcm(num1,num2)) print(gcd(num1,num2)) print(factorial(num1)) print(factorial(num2)) print(pow(num1,num2)) print(pow(num2,num1)) . 10 2 10 2 10 .

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a Python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . . . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . Python Example: . def binary_search(array, find): # where array is the given array and find is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible sublists... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == find: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; find: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half else: # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found # case 1 array = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] find = 10 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 10 is not present at index 3 # Question: What is the maximum number of iterations given this array? # case 2 array = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] find = 30 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 30 is not present in array # case 3 array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 ] find = 83 result = binary_search(array, find) if result != False: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is present at index {str(result)}&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Requested value {find} is not present in array&quot;) # Expected output: Requested value 83 is not present at index 82 # you can see how efficient this is, only requiring 7 iterations instead of {insert number of iterations going 1 by 1 would take because im too lazy to calculate it} # Question: What is the maximum number of iterations given this array? .",

This inspired me, and gave me an idea for a project next tirmester: . trying to make the game myself | making a stat tracker for some other games (eg FPS win%) | . Art projects . I also went to see the work n the AP Studio Art classroom, and was very impressed by what I saw. Many of the drawings were extremely realistic and even looked like photographs. The many hours that must have been poured into projects like these truly show the dedication they have for this project.

            "content": "Quiz blog . Mental health class at yale: Psychology and the Good Life . Students at yale thought that there was a lot of stress, can’t get the full usage of college, little time to do what they want . It takes a crisis to realize something is wrong . 40% of college students are stressed above normal . 1/3 of college students are “depressed to the point they cant function” . 40% of college students feel hopeless . just under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety, and this has gone up to 60% in 2017 . This is really bad, especially if these students are going to the workforce . Yale realized that they could attempt to fix this by psychology research . Researching on the mental of happy people . Teach students on how to become more like these people . This class has 2 parts, the psychology behind it and how to apply it . do the same practices that happy people do as part of the syllabus . A lot of students took this class, showing that it was really beneficial . What this class teaches: . we can controls a lot more of our happiness than we think | half glass or half empty type of person | there is some part of happiness is controlled by genes, the other half is controlled by you | we need to take the initiative to controls it and make ourselves happy | What we think makes us happy doesn’t actually make us happy and vice versa | ex: lottery winner is happy on the day of, then not after | it takes a lot of effort to make us happy | to be more happy you need to make changes that take effort every day | GI joe fallacy, knowing is part of the battle but not half | you need to work to build upon the knowledge | Our minds lies to us about whenever we are happy | EX: our minds forecast we need money so we can be happy, then that determines you job but it doesn’t actually make you happy | Our mind is greedy | The “limit” to how happy salary can make you is 75k, after that a jump in salary doesn’t make you happier | Forecasts of happiness are mostly fake, actual happiness doesn’t come from forecasting | happy people prioritize people in their life | Experiment about being social vs avoiding social contact | Forecast how the subject thinks its going to go | said that talking would make them less happy and solitude would make them more happy | results were the exact opposite | to be happier, spend time trying to be happier | helping others will help you be happier | very happy people spend time with and for others | another study with money and spending it for yourself or spending money for someone else and the amount of money they spent | Results: amount of money doesn’t matter, spending money for others makes you happier than spending it for yourself | treating ourselves doesn’t actually make us happier | make time for gratitude | our minds fixate on negative things | talking about negative things will reduce your happiness | talking about good things even just once a week will increase your happiness | Thanking someone randomly isn’t awkward, it bumps up both person’s happiness | healthy practices matter much more than we think | EX: excessive | excessive helps our physical and mental health | cardio makes people happier for 24 hours | high school students sleep 4-5 hours a night | this has a negative impact on their mood | having low amounts of sleep causes most mental health crises | Being present in the moment helps boost your mood | having your mind wandering to happy things, sad things, or even neutral things will hurt your mental | Notice what you are doing when you do something happy | savor the good things in life | meditation helps you reduce the areas in your brain that wander | be wealthy in time | people who have more time are happier | sacrificing time to have money makes you more depressed | sacrificing money to have time makes you less depressed | students were much happier when they had an hour to themselves, not allowed to do other homework | . We need to change the culture about mental health everywhere . we need to take the idea that something is wrong and do something about it . For college students alcohol is a problem because of coping with their mental . As we get older we get happier, this is because after you retire you have more time, have more time for connections, etc. .",

For loop . As seen here: . for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) . The for loop is looping through all questions and grading the responses. It is doing this by referencing the index of the value in the list of all questions. I am able to make sure that no matter the size of the list, I am always able to be confident that I will loop through all questions, as I am using the the variable questions, representing the total amount of entries in the list. . If statement . As seen here: . def gradeResponse(response, answer): global correct # convert to lowercase so ppl don&#39;t yell at me for scoring them as wrong when they went &quot;prinT&quot; if response.lower() == answer: print(f&quot;{response} is correct! nGood job :D&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(f&quot;{response} is incorrect! nBetter luck next time :(&quot;) . The if statement is checking if the answers response corresponds to the answer in the answers list. If so, then it will award the user with a point, as well as letting them know that they were correct. If the user was wrong, meaning their response didn&#39;t match the defined answer, the program will not add a point, and let the user know that they have gotten the question incorrect. . While loop . As there is no while loop in this program, I will provide an example of a possible usage of a while loop here: . i = 0 while i &lt; 10: i += 1 print(f&quot;Hello World {i}!&quot;) . This while statement will print out the statement &quot;Hello world {i}&quot;, where i is the current value that the loop is on. This loop will print out a total of 10 statements, from the values of 1, all the way up to 10. .",

Code explanation . I import the getpass library that way I can personalize it and say the user name. The function question_with_response asks the question and returns the user answer, named msg. For every question in the list questions, I pass the variable msg into rsp and send it to the gradeResponse function, along with the corresponding answer. gradeResponse will then check if the answer is correct and award a point to the user if it is. At the end of the quiz, it will display how many out of the total questions were correct. .",

Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: are input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Procedural Abstraction: a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: method or function . Why are procedures effective?: reduces the complexity and amount of code present . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): n=int(n) n=bin(n) return n[2:] binary=convertToBinary(96) print(binary) . 1100000 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . Array.prototype.max = function() { return Math.max.apply(null, this); }; Array.prototype.min = function() { return Math.min.apply(null, this); }; function maxMin(array, operation) { var res = &quot;Error: invalid input(s)&quot; if (operation == &quot;max&quot;) { res = array.max() } else if (operation == &quot;min&quot;) { res = array.min() } return res } var array = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var array = [35, 2, 65, 7, 8, 9, 12, 121, 33, 99] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) . i can&#39;t run javascript on my notebook but here is the expected result: .

Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): output = [] for char in x: decimal = ord(char) binary = bin(decimal) binary = (binary)[2:] output.append(f&quot;0{binary}&quot;) return output binary_output = charToBinary(&quot;APCSP&quot;) print(binary_output) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .
