Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . . . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. .

This inspired me, and gave me an idea for a project next tirmester: . trying to make the game myself | making a stat tracker for some other games (eg FPS win%) | . Art projects . I also went to see the work n the AP Studio Art classroom, and was very impressed by what I saw. Many of the drawings were extremely realistic and even looked like photographs. The many hours that must have been poured into projects like these truly show the dedication they have for this project. I also went to the ceramics classroom, and was very captivated by the banana dolphin project, as I thought it was funny and also really like dolphins.

Students at yale thought that there was a lot of stress, can’t get the full usage of college, little time to do what they want . It takes a crisis to realize something is wrong . 40% of college students are stressed above normal . 1/3 of college students are “depressed to the point they cant function” . 40% of college students feel hopeless . just under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety, and this has gone up to 60% in 2017 . This is really bad, especially if these students are going to the workforce . Yale realized that they could attempt to fix this by psychology research . Researching on the mental of happy people . Teach students on how to become more like these people . This class has 2 parts, the psychology behind it and how to apply it . do the same practices that happy people do as part of the syllabus . A lot of students took this class, showing that it was really beneficial . What this class teaches: . we can controls a lot more of our happiness than we think | half glass or half empty type of person | there is some part of happiness is controlled by genes, the other half is controlled by you | we need to take the initiative to controls it and make ourselves happy | What we think makes us happy doesn’t actually make us happy and vice versa | ex: lottery winner is happy on the day of, then not after | it takes a lot of effort to make us happy | to be more happy you need to make changes that take effort every day | GI joe fallacy, knowing is part of the battle but not half | you need to work to build upon the knowledge | Our minds lies to us about whenever we are happy | EX: our minds forecast we need money so we can be happy, then that determines you job but it doesn’t actually make you happy | Our mind is greedy | The “limit” to how happy salary can make you is 75k, after that a jump in salary doesn’t make you happier | Forecasts of happiness are mostly fake, actual happiness doesn’t come from forecasting | happy people prioritize people in their life | Experiment about being social vs avoiding social contact | Forecast how the subject thinks its going to go | said that talking would make them less happy and solitude would make them more happy | results were the exact opposite | to be happier, spend time trying to be happier | helping others will help you be happier | very happy people spend time with and for others | another study with money and spending it for yourself or spending money for someone else and the amount of money they spent | Results: amount of money doesn’t matter, spending money for others makes you happier than spending it for yourself | treating ourselves doesn’t actually make us happier | make time for gratitude | our minds fixate on negative things | talking about negative things will reduce your happiness | talking about good things even just once a week will increase your happiness | Thanking someone randomly isn’t awkward, it bumps up both person’s happiness | healthy practices matter much more than we think | EX: excessive | excessive helps our physical and mental health | cardio makes people happier for 24 hours | high school students sleep 4-5 hours a night | this has a negative impact on their mood | having low amounts of sleep causes most mental health crises | Being present in the moment helps boost your mood | having your mind wandering to happy things, sad things, or even neutral things will hurt your mental | Notice what you are doing when you do something happy | savor the good things in life | meditation helps you reduce the areas in your brain that wander | be wealthy in time | people who have more time are happier | sacrificing time to have money makes you more depressed | sacrificing money to have time makes you less depressed | students were much happier when they had an hour to themselves, not allowed to do other homework | . We need to change the culture about mental health everywhere . we need to take the idea that something is wrong and do something about it . For college students alcohol is a problem because of coping with their mental . As we get older we get happier, this is because after you retire you have more time, have more time for connections, etc. .",

Referenced code: . import getpass # question format, gets user answer def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg # lists of questions/answers prompts=[&quot;What command would you use to display text into the terminal?&quot;, &quot;What command would you use to ask the user for information?&quot;, &quot;What is the keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;, &quot;How would you write a print statement to concatenate a string containing variable A with string &#39;Hello&#39;? (include print() and use &#39;&#39; instead of &quot; &quot;&quot;, &quot;How do we add a pre-made library to our code?&quot;, &quot;We use _______ to store information for later use.&quot;, &quot;Given the code, {variable = 1} what type of variable is this?&quot;, &quot;Given the code, {variable = 1.1} what type of variable is this?&quot;, &quot;Given the code, {variable = &#39;Hello&#39;} what type of variable is this?&quot;] answers=[&quot;print&quot;, &quot;input&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;hello&#39; + a)&quot;, &quot;import&quot;, &quot;variables&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;float&quot;, &quot;string&quot;] correct = 0 questions = len(prompts) # corrects answers, awards a point if correct def gradeResponse(response, answer): global correct # convert to lowercase so ppl don&#39;t yell at me for scoring them as wrong when they went &quot;prinT&quot; if response.lower() == answer: print(f&quot;{response} is correct! nGood job :D&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(f&quot;{response} is incorrect! nBetter luck next time :(&quot;) # ask user if they want to proceed, exit if no print(f&quot;Hello {getpass.getuser()}!&quot;) print(f&quot;You will be asked {str(questions)} questions.&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a quiz? [Y/n]&quot;) if rsp.lower() == &quot;y&quot;: print(&quot;Lets get started!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Bye :(&quot;) exit() # cycle through all questions, score the questions for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) # calculate percentage percentage=(correct/questions)*100 percentage=round(percentage, 2) # report score print(f&quot;You got a total of {correct} out of {questions} ({percentage}%)!&quot;) . For loop . As seen here: . for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) . The for loop is looping through all questions and grading the responses. It is doing this by referencing the index of the value in the list of all questions. I am able to make sure that no matter the size of the list, I am always able to be confident that I will loop through all questions, as I am using the the variable questions, representing the total amount of entries in the list. . If statement . As seen here: . def gradeResponse(response, answer): global correct # convert to lowercase so ppl don&#39;t yell at me for scoring them as wrong when they went &quot;prinT&quot; if response.lower() == answer: print(f&quot;{response} is correct! nGood job :D&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(f&quot;{response} is incorrect! nBetter luck next time :(&quot;) . The if statement is checking if the answers response corresponds to the answer in the answers list. If so, then it will award the user with a point, as well as letting them know that they were correct. If the user was wrong, meaning their response didn&#39;t match the defined answer, the program will not add a point, and let the user know that they have gotten the question incorrect. . While loop . As there is no while loop in this program, I will provide an example of a possible usage of a while loop here: . i = 0 while i &lt; 10: i += 1 print(f&quot;Hello World {i}!&quot;) . This while statement will print out the statement &quot;Hello world {i}&quot;, where i is the current value that the loop is on. This loop will print out a total of 10 statements, from the values of 1, all the way up to 10. .",

Good job :D Question: Given the code, {variable = &#39;Hello&#39;} what type of variable is this? bool is incorrect! Better luck next time :( You got a total of 8 out of 9 (88.89%)! . Code explanation . I import the getpass library that way I can personalize it and say the user name. The function question_with_response asks the question and returns the user answer, named msg. For every question in the list questions, I pass the variable msg into rsp and send it to the gradeResponse function, along with the corresponding answer. gradeResponse will then check if the answer is correct and award a point to the user if it is. At the end of the quiz, it will display how many out of the total questions were correct. .",

            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: are input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Procedural Abstraction: a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: method or function . Why are procedures effective?: reduces the complexity and amount of code present . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): n=int(n) n=bin(n) return n[2:] binary=convertToBinary(96) print(binary) . 1100000 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . Array.prototype.max = function() { return Math.max.apply(null, this); }; Array.prototype.min = function() { return Math.min.apply(null, this); }; function maxMin(array, operation) { var res = &quot;Error: invalid input(s)&quot; if (operation == &quot;max&quot;) { res = array.max() } else if (operation == &quot;min&quot;) { res = array.min() } return res } var array = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var array = [35, 2, 65, 7, 8, 9, 12, 121, 33, 99] var res = maxMin(array, &quot;max&quot;) console.log(&quot;Maximum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) var res = maxMin(array, &quot;min&quot;) console.log(&quot;Minimum of array &quot; + array + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + res) . i can&#39;t run javascript on my notebook but here is the expected result: .

Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): output = [] for char in x: decimal = ord(char) binary = bin(decimal) binary = (binary)[2:] output.append(f&quot;0{binary}&quot;) return output binary_output = charToBinary(&quot;APCSP&quot;) print(binary_output) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
