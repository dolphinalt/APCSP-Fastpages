            "content": "Quiz blog . Mental health class at yale: Psychology and the Good Life . Students at yale thought that there was a lot of stress, can’t get the full usage of college, little time to do what they want . It takes a crisis to realize something is wrong . 40% of college students are stressed above normal . 1/3 of college students are “depressed to the point they cant function” . 40% of college students feel hopeless . just under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety, and this has gone up to 60% in 2017 . This is really bad, especially if these students are going to the workforce . Yale realized that they could attempt to fix this by psychology research . Researching on the mental of happy people . Teach students on how to become more like these people . This class has 2 parts, the psychology behind it and how to apply it . do the same practices that happy people do as part of the syllabus . A lot of students took this class, showing that it was really beneficial . What this class teaches: . we can controls a lot more of our happiness than we think | half glass or half empty type of person | there is some part of happiness is controlled by genes, the other half is controlled by you | we need to take the initiative to controls it and make ourselves happy | What we think makes us happy doesn’t actually make us happy and vice versa | ex: lottery winner is happy on the day of, then not after | it takes a lot of effort to make us happy | to be more happy you need to make changes that take effort every day | GI joe fallacy, knowing is part of the battle but not half | you need to work to build upon the knowledge | Our minds lies to us about whenever we are happy | EX: our minds forecast we need money so we can be happy, then that determines you job but it doesn’t actually make you happy | Our mind is greedy | The “limit” to how happy salary can make you is 75k, after that a jump in salary doesn’t make you happier | Forecasts of happiness are mostly fake, actual happiness doesn’t come from forecasting | happy people prioritize people in their life | Experiment about being social vs avoiding social contact | Forecast how the subject thinks its going to go | said that talking would make them less happy and solitude would make them more happy | results were the exact opposite | to be happier, spend time trying to be happier | helping others will help you be happier | very happy people spend time with and for others | another study with money and spending it for yourself or spending money for someone else and the amount of money they spent | Results: amount of money doesn’t matter, spending money for others makes you happier than spending it for yourself | treating ourselves doesn’t actually make us happier | make time for gratitude | our minds fixate on negative things | talking about negative things will reduce your happiness | talking about good things even just once a week will increase your happiness | Thanking someone randomly isn’t awkward, it bumps up both person’s happiness | healthy practices matter much more than we think | EX: excessive | excessive helps our physical and mental health | cardio makes people happier for 24 hours | high school students sleep 4-5 hours a night | this has a negative impact on their mood | having low amounts of sleep causes most mental health crises | Being present in the moment helps boost your mood | having your mind wandering to happy things, sad things, or even neutral things will hurt your mental | Notice what you are doing when you do something happy | savor the good things in life | meditation helps you reduce the areas in your brain that wander | be wealthy in time | people who have more time are happier | sacrificing time to have money makes you more depressed | sacrificing money to have time makes you less depressed | students were much happier when they had an hour to themselves, not allowed to do other homework | . We need to change the culture about mental health everywhere . we need to take the idea that something is wrong and do something about it . For college students alcohol is a problem because of coping with their mental . As we get older we get happier, this is because after you retire you have more time, have more time for connections, etc. .",

[Y/n]&quot;) if rsp.lower() == &quot;y&quot;: print(&quot;Lets get started!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Bye :(&quot;) exit() # cycle through all questions, score the questions for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) # calculate percentage percentage=(correct/questions)*100 percentage=round(percentage, 2) # report score print(f&quot;You got a total of {correct} out of {questions} ({percentage}%)!&quot;) . For loop . As seen here: . for i in range(0, questions): rsp = question_with_response(prompts[i]) gradeResponse(rsp, answers[i]) . The for loop is looping through all questions and grading the responses. It is doing this by referencing the index of the value in the list of all questions. I am able to make sure that no matter the size of the list, I am always able to be confident that I will loop through all questions, as I am using the the variable questions, representing the total amount of entries in the list. . If statement . As seen here: . def gradeResponse(response, answer): global correct # convert to lowercase so ppl don&#39;t yell at me for scoring them as wrong when they went &quot;prinT&quot; if response.lower() == answer: print(f&quot;{response} is correct! nGood job :D&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(f&quot;{response} is incorrect! nBetter luck next time :(&quot;) . The if statement is checking if the answers response corresponds to the answer in the answers list. If so, then it will award the user with a point, as well as letting them know that they were correct. If the user was wrong, meaning their response didn&#39;t match the defined answer, the program will not add a point, and let the user know that they have gotten the question incorrect. . While loop . As there is no while loop in this program, I will provide an example of a possible usage of a while loop here: . i = 0 while i &lt; 10: i += 1 print(f&quot;Hello World {i}!&quot;) . This while statement will print out the statement &quot;Hello world {i}&quot;, where i is the current value that the loop is on. This loop will print out a total of 10 statements, from the values of 1, all the way up to 10. .",

Good job :D Question: How would you write a print statement to concatenate a string containing variable A with string &#39;Hello&#39;?

Good job :D Question: Given the code, {variable = &#39;Hello&#39;} what type of variable is this? bool is incorrect! Better luck next time :( You got a total of 8 out of 9 (88.89%)! . Code explanation . I import the getpass library that way I can personalize it and say the user name. The function question_with_response asks the question and returns the user answer, named msg. For every question in the list questions, I pass the variable msg into rsp and send it to the gradeResponse function, along with the corresponding answer. gradeResponse will then check if the answer is correct and award a point to the user if it is. At the end of the quiz, it will display how many out of the total questions were correct. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
