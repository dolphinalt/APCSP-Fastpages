<p>I was consistantly grading much more leinently than college board did, might be because I am still not very familiar for every single one of the requirements to be met.</p>

</h3>
<p>On my program, I need to make sure that I have detailed testing in order to fulfill all requirements for the performance task.</p>

</h3>
<p>The submissions that failed to meet the standerds failed due to them not being able to meet every single sub-requirement, while I was not checking each sub-requirement in very much detail.</p>
