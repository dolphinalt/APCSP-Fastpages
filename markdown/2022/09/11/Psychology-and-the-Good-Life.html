<p>Mental health class at yale: Psychology and the Good Life</p>

<p>Students at yale thought that there was a lot of stress, can’t get the full usage of college, little time to do what they want</p>

<p>It takes a crisis to realize something is wrong</p>

<p>40% of college students are stressed above normal</p>

<p>1/3 of college students are “depressed to the point they cant function”</p>

<p>40% of college students feel hopeless</p>

<p>just under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety, and this has gone up to 60% in 2017</p>

<p>This is really bad, especially if these students are going to the workforce</p>

<p>Yale realized that they could attempt to fix this by psychology research</p>

<p>Researching on the mental of happy people</p>

<p>Teach students on how to become more like these people</p>

<p>This class has 2 parts, the psychology behind it and how to apply it</p>

<p>do the same practices that happy people do as part of the syllabus</p>

<p>A lot of students took this class, showing that it was really beneficial</p>

<p>What this class teaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we can controls a lot more of our happiness than we think</li>
  <li>half glass or half empty type of person</li>
  <li>there is some part of happiness is controlled by genes, the other half is controlled by you</li>
  <li>we need to take the initiative to controls it and make ourselves happy</li>
  <li>What we think makes us happy doesn’t actually make us happy and vice versa</li>
  <li>ex: lottery winner is happy on the day of, then not after</li>
  <li>it takes a lot of effort to make us happy</li>
  <li>to be more happy you need to make changes that take effort every day</li>
  <li>GI joe fallacy, knowing is part of the battle but not half</li>
  <li>you need to work to build upon the knowledge</li>
  <li>Our minds lies to us about whenever we are happy</li>
  <li>EX: our minds forecast we need money so we can be happy, then that determines you job but it doesn’t actually make you happy</li>
  <li>Our mind is greedy</li>
  <li>The “limit” to how happy salary can make you is 75k, after that a jump in salary doesn’t make you happier</li>
  <li>Forecasts of happiness are mostly fake, actual happiness doesn’t come from forecasting</li>
  <li>happy people prioritize people in their life</li>
  <li>Experiment about being social vs avoiding social contact</li>
  <li>Forecast how the subject thinks its going to go</li>
  <li>said that talking would make them less happy and solitude would make them more happy</li>
  <li>results were the exact opposite</li>
  <li>to be happier, spend time trying to be happier</li>
  <li>helping others will help you be happier</li>
  <li>very happy people spend time with and for others</li>
  <li>another study with money and spending it for yourself or spending money for someone else and the amount of money they spent</li>
  <li>Results: amount of money doesn’t matter, spending money for others makes you happier than spending it for yourself</li>
  <li>treating ourselves doesn’t actually make us happier</li>
  <li>make time for gratitude</li>
  <li>our minds fixate on negative things</li>
  <li>talking about negative things will reduce your happiness</li>
  <li>talking about good things even just once a week will increase your happiness</li>
  <li>Thanking someone randomly isn’t awkward, it bumps up both person’s happiness</li>
  <li>healthy practices matter much more than we think</li>
  <li>EX: excessive</li>
  <li>excessive helps our physical and mental health</li>
  <li>cardio makes people happier for 24 hours</li>
  <li>high school students sleep 4-5 hours a night</li>
  <li>this has a negative impact on their mood</li>
  <li>having low amounts of sleep causes most mental health crises</li>
  <li>Being present in the moment helps boost your mood</li>
  <li>having your mind wandering to happy things, sad things, or even neutral things will hurt your mental</li>
  <li>Notice what you are doing when you do something happy</li>
  <li>savor the good things in life</li>
  <li>meditation helps you reduce the areas in your brain that wander</li>
  <li>be wealthy in time</li>
  <li>people who have more time are happier</li>
  <li>sacrificing time to have money makes you more depressed</li>
  <li>sacrificing money to have time makes you less depressed</li>
  <li>students were much happier when they had an hour to themselves, not allowed to do other homework</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to change the culture about mental health everywhere</p>

<p>we need to take the idea that something is wrong and do something about it</p>

<p>For college students alcohol is a problem because of coping with their mental</p>

<p>As we get older we get happier, this is because after you retire you have more time, have more time for connections, etc.</p>
