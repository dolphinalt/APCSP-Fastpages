    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called Abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?\n",
    "\n",
    "24 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers, Text, Colors, Images, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits are a digital form of storing data, as the bits are virtualized. Analog forms of storing data are physical, such as a CD or a DVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary.\n",
    "    - 0 = False\n",
    "    - 1 = True\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in ________ or other errors.\n",
    "* Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory.\n",
    "* Fixed number of bits are used to represent real numbers/limits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. What is the largest number can be represented by 5 bits?\n",
    "\n",
    "1+2+4+8+16 = 31 (2^5 - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language?\n",
    "\n",
    "2^56 / 2^16 = 2^40\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 5 bits are used to represent both positive and negative numbers, what is the largest number that can be represented by these bits? (*hint: different than question 1*)\n",
    "\n",
    "15, because when you represent negative numbers, the first bit represents the sign, meaning there are 4 usable bits. 2^4 - 1 = 15.\n",

    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1.\n",
    "* Decimal is Base 10, meaning eacht digit can represent values from 0 to 9.\n",
    "* Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This is because the Base word means each base (or integer) can hold N values, in this case, 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hexadecimal is base 16. Each digit can represent values from 0 to 9, and A to F.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system?\n",
    "\n",
    "N would represent the Base 10 number 10 in a Base 30 system. In a Base 50 system, the letter would still be M, as the ways that you would represent numbers past 9 are the same in all bases.\n",

    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Using 6 bits, we can represent 64 numbers, from 0 to 63, as 2^6 = 64.\n",
