# APCSP Project
We were able to demonstrate our own project to many people, as well as being able to demonstrate the project to many adults as well, who were thoroughly impressed! We were also able to go around and take a look at many other projects, such as the "Don't Leave Me" project as well as projects from Claire and Safin's groups, and many others. It was a great experience, and I also got many inspirations for future projects, such as projects in which users can review items or locations from many other users, in a fassiopn similar to something like yelp. The "Don't Leave Me" project also caught my eye, as it had a great UI design, with functionality kept in mind.

# Art projects
I also went to see the 3d art and animation classes, as well as the photography and pottery classes. The art in these classrooms were amazing, and I was very inspired by the skill and time necessarily to make such works of art. Although I didn't particulary like the 3d animation and art classes, I did think that the photography and pottery classes were amazing. The way the artists use different means or designs to express their emotions and feelings is amazing, and I was very inspired by the works of art that I saw. I also learned that I should try to be more creative in my own art, and try to express my own feelings and emotions through my art, rather than just making art for the sake of making art.
