# Reflection
The panel opened many informative and interesting insights into college and the lifestyles of CSSM students. The speakers, John and Ashley, described how it would be like to go through a STEM related field at their college and gave us advice on how to proceed when we end up going into a STEM field at whichever college we end up at in the future. Being almost 100% certain that I want to go into CS as a major, I will definitely take their valuable insights to heart, and I hope that I can apply them to my future college life. The project we did with the toothbrush bugs at the end was really fun and interesting! It was a great way to end the panel, and I hope that we can do more projects like this in the future with other panels. Overall, this was a great panel, and I will definitely plan on attending more panels like this in the future!
