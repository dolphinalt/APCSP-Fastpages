### Q2
**My answer**: C
**Correct answer**: A
An email address by its self won't cause much harm, however, an email password would. The answer is A because cookies stored in the user's Web browser can contain saved passwords, creditcard info, and more, all accessable without a password.

### Q4
**My answer**: D
**Correct answer**: A
The correct answer here is D, as having the data in a database will only need to more data stored, increacing the need for data compression. However, having all the data in a singular database allows for easy analysis of the data within calling sessions, and make updates and decisions based on the data.

### Q7
**My answer**: C
**Correct answer**: A
Of the three answer choices, only I was not needed by the original system, as there was no need for the customer to verbally disclose what they wanted to pick, all they needed was to select a number on a keypad. However, a call into the system is still nesscary, therefore choice III was needed.


### Q29
**My answer**: D
**Correct answer**: B
The correct answer here was B, because in step 4, `a` is being assigned the value of `NOT (a OR b) AND c`. `a` was assigned with `true` in step one, `b` assigned with `false` and `c` assigned with `true`. Therefore, `NOT (a OR b)` is the opposite of `a or b`, which is the opposite of `true`, being `false`. `false AND c` is `false`, therefore `a` is assigned with `false`. Taking this value of `a` equaling `false` and doing `c AND a` results in `false AND false`, which is `false`. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

### Q49
**My answer**: D
**Correct answer**: B
Simulations will lack important details. Wether it is because of the programers forgeting a detail or an unexpected detail pops up, simulations will not be able to account for every detail, and may omit details to make it easier to implement.
