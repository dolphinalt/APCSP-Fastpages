# Defenitions
## Unit 2 - Binary/Data Terms
**Bits** - Most basic unit of info in computing.

**Bytes** - Unit of info in computing consisting of 8 bits.

**Hexadecimal** - A way of representing data using 16 symbols.

**Nibbles** - Half of a byte, 4 bits.

**Unsigned Integer** - A number that doesn't have a [+] or [-] sign assigned to it. However, it will always be non-negative.

**Signed Integer** - A number that has a [+] or [-] sign assigned to it. It can be negative or positive.

**Floating Point** - A positive or negative integer with a decimal point.

**Boolean** - A value that is either true or false.

**ASCII** - stands for **A**merican **S**tandard **C**ode for **I**nformation **I**nterchange, and includes all printable characters in computing.

**Unicode** - A universal standard for the encoding, representation, and handling of text.

**RGB** - Stands for **R**ed **G**reen **B**lue and is used as a representation of color

**Lossy** - Short for lossy compression, a data compression approach that results in loss or change of data.

**Lossless (not discussed yet)** - Short for losless compression, a data compression approach that allows for no loss or change in data.


## Unit 3 - Algorithm/Programming Terms
**Variables** - A storage of data within a programming language.

**Data Types** - Represents different types of data, such as integers, strings, booleans, floats, and many more.

**Assignment Operators** - Assigns a value to a variable.

**Lists** - A data type that contains some amount of values.

**2D Lists** - Multiple lists within one list, creating almost a sort of visualized 2d rectangle.

**Dictionaries** - An array or map that stores an abstraction of key, value pairs.

**Class** - An object in a programming language with multiple attributes assigned to it.

**Algorithms** - A sequence of instructions to perform a task.

**Sequence** - A sequence is a set of commands to be carried out in the order they are given.

**Selection** - Grabbing a value from a list, string, or any other data type.

**Iteration** - Going through each index in a list, string, or any other data type.

**Expressions** - A combination of functions or variables that returns a value.

**Comparison Operators** - Opperators that allow us to compare 2 or more variables to each other.

**Booleans Expressions and Selection** - Expressions involving selection and comparisons, resulting in a true or false output.

**Booleans Expressions and Iteration** - Expressions involving an iteration through a list or any other data type resulting in a true or false output.

**Truth Tables** - A logical table to compare binary based on logical operations.

**Characters** - Each individual letter in a string.

**Strings** - A combination of characters.

**Length** - The length in chracters or items of a string or list.

**Concatenation** - Combining multiple strings together.

**Upper** - Converting a string to all uppercase.

**Lower** - Converting a string to all lowercase.

**Traversing Strings** - Selecting all elements of as string one after another.

**Python If** - `if condition:` An expression for if a condition is true or false.

**Elif** - `elif condition:` An expression for if a condition is true or false AFTER a condition has been false.

**Else conditionals** - `else:` An expression for if a condition is true or false if no other if statements or elif statements have been true.

**Nested Selection Statements** - Multiple statements within each other.

**Python For** - `for condition:` For the time that the condition is true, do things inside of the loop.

**While loops with Range** - `while var comparison range(string):` While the condition is true, do things inside of the loop.

**While loops with List** - `while var comparison range(list):` While the condition is true, do things inside of the loop.

**Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue** - Continue past the loop if condition is met, stop the loop if the condition is met.

**Procedural Abstraction** - When you know what a procedure or method will du but don't know how it does it.

**Python Def procedures** - `def function(parameters):` A function defined in python.

**Parameters** - Arguments that are passed into a function.

**Return Values** - `return value` A variable that is returned from a function.
