### Q11:

A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information.

 - Name of artist performing at the show

 - Date of show

 - Total dollar amount of all tickets sold

Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month?

(A) Average ticket price

(B) Length of the show in minutes

(C) Start time of the show

(D) Total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during the show

**My answer**: D

**Correct answer**: A

While D may provide some insight into how many people attended the show, however it doesn't account for people buying more food than others. Being able to have the average ticket price would allow us to divide it with the total amount of all tickets sold, giving us the amount of people attending the show.

### Q12:

The owner of a clothing store records the following information for each transaction made at the store during a 7-day period.

 - The date of the transaction

 - The method of payment used in the transaction

 - The number of items purchased in the transaction

 - The total amount of the transaction, in dollars

 - Customers can pay for purchases using cash, check, a debit card, or a credit card.

Using only the data collected during the 7-day period, which of the following statements is true?

**My answer**: B

**Correct answer**: D

The correct answer is D, because the data includes the date of each transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined.
