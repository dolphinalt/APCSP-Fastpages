## Scoring:

### **Submission 1**

| Reporting Category | My Score | Reasoning | College Board Scoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student has a clear section in both the video and the written segment that shows the input, output, and purpose of their program | 0 |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | The student has both code segments required, however lists described are not used within these segments. | 0 |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | A list is clearly shown to be used to simplify the complexity of the program, as well as an explanation for why the program would be different without the list. | 0 |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | The writeup doesn't show how the procedure works with the remainder of the program. | 0 |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | The writeup does not provide a detailed enough description of how to replicate the procedure | 0 |
| Testing | 1 | The writeup clearly shows the user testing their program thuroughly. | 1 |
| Total | 3 | Reasoning as shown above | 1 |

### **Submission 2**

| Reporting Category | My Score | Reasoning | College Board Scoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The writeup clearly describes the input, output, and porupsoe of their program | 1 |
| Data Abstraction | 1 |The writeup clearly shows how words are being collected into a list, abstracting them to be used within the program | 1 |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | The writeup shows how lists are used to simplify the complexity of the program, as well as a detailed description of how it would be different without a list | 1 |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | All prodecures are shown were described in detail within the writeup, and clearly shows relation to the remainder of the program | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The writeup was described in enough detail for anybody to read it and replicate the procedure | 1 |
| Testing | 1 | Very thourough testing and good writeup of the conditions used for testing of the program | 1 |
| Total | 6 | Reasoning as shown above | 6 |

### **Submission 3**

| Reporting Category | My Score | Reasoning | College Board Scoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The writeup clearly describes the input, output, and porupsoe of their program | 0 |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | Writeup demonstrates data abstraction being used to assist the program | 1 |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | Writeup shows code segmenet using a list and iterating through the list. It also describes how it would be diferent without a list | 1 |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | All prodecures are shown were described in detail within the writeup, and clearly shows relation to the remainder of the program | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The writeup was described in enough detail for anybody to read it and replicate the procedure | 1 |
| Testing | 1 | Very thourough testing and good writeup of the conditions used for testing of the program | 1 |
| Total | 6 | Reasoning as shown above | 5 |

### **Submission 4**

| Reporting Category | My Score | Reasoning | College Board Scoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The writeup clearly describes the input, output, and porupsoe of their program | 1 |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | No list was provided for use in the program | 0 |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | No list was used in the program, no description on why it would be different without a list | 0 |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | All prodecures are shown were described in detail within the writeup, and clearly shows relation to the remainder of the program | 1 |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The writeup was described in enough detail for anybody to read it and replicate the procedure | 1 |
| Testing | 1 | Testing was detailed, showing different scenareos with different results from the calls | 0 |
| Total | 4 | Reasoning as shown above | 3 |




## Reflection:

### **on any discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring**
I was consistantly grading much more leinently than college board did, might be because I am still not very familiar for every single one of the requirements to be met.

### **on what your program will need to fulfill all requirements**
On my program, I need to make sure that I have detailed testing in order to fulfill all requirements for the performance task.

### **on the criteria and why a submission may have failed to meet the standard**
The submissions that failed to meet the standerds failed due to them not being able to meet every single sub-requirement, while I was not checking each sub-requirement in very much detail.
