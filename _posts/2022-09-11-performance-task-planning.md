# Performance task - WEB SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE GENERATOR
## Planning
### [Scrum Board]("https://github.com/raisinbran25/csp2/issues/6") - Shared with Jaden Nguyen
 - [ ] Include these services ["Apache", "LightHTTPD", "Nginx"]
 - [ ] Ask for http or https
 - [ ] Make file paths fully customizable
 - [ ] Include option to secure, have easy graphical interface to enable/disable features
 - [ ] Have easy export/wget option to directly download file(s)
 - [ ] Interactive, animations if possible (hopefully)
 - [ ] R E A C T ? ? ?

This shouldn't be too difficult to implement, I already have experience with Apache and Nginx servers, and it'll be a good experience to learn how to set up LightHTTPD servers

Will host this on ethanzhao.us, that way I can create temporary files that you can wget?

Watch out, if hosting on server its possible to exploit through the file somehow, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF ANY EXECUTE PERMISSIONS

## Timeline (gonna be pretty loose because im not 100% committed yet)
 - End of T1, complete site layout, all configuration files/security settings ready for implementation
 - End of T2, everything is on html (just bare bones html)
 - Up until when it is due, add any extra things I want (interactive animations, wget, other unnecessary features)
