1. **Powerful laptops**

2. **Ad Blockers**

| Overview | Benefits | Harms |

| Add blockers are used to block unwanted ads from websites. However useful this may be, there are a few obvious flaws.

3. **Tik Tok - Dopamine issue**

| Overview | Benefits | Harms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tik Tok is hard wired to deliver as much Dopamine as possible, in the shortest amount of time possible. This results in loss of attention for the user when doing everyday tasks.

# Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide

**How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?**

The best way to empower yourself in a digital world is steer clear from things that may harm self confidence, or may put you in danger. For example, try not to spend too much time on the toxic environment of social media. Another thing is to try and stay away from talking about specifics online, such as your age, name, gender, and many more.

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping them to learn about the dangers of internet, how to secure themselves from outside threats. You can also guide them about basic internet etiquette that way they don't become the bullier, as well as the victim. At del norte, there are already many clubs relating to this topic, such as cybersecurity clubs, CyberAegis, and many more.

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Yes, the idea that the only way to prevent the negative effects of internet is to stay off of it as well as the idea that social media is always bad are some types of red tapes blocking digital empowerment. These barriers are shown at Del Norte, as shown with the extremely restrictive access to parts of the windows pcs at school, where in reality it would be a good idea to allow students to be exposed to these security options. Elsewhere, many parents are under the impression that all social media is bad, however, if you learn to use social media properly, it isn't always bad.s
