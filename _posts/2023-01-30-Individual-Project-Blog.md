| Program Purpose and Function | Description of purpose below |
| Data Abstraction | Data is abstracted into a database |
| Managing Complexity | Manages complexity by storing all info within database |
| Procedural Abstraction | The program will procedurally compare your schedule to other people's schedules |
| Algorithm Implementation | Searching algorithm for comparing schedules |
| Testing | Test adding bad values, wrong password, wrong username, etc |

# Portion description

## Concept

Create an easy way for people to share schedules and compare it against their friend's schedules for an easy way to see who is in your class. This will be done through displaying rotating cards with highlighted classes being the classes you have in common.

## Code Plan

Create a database generator code using inspiration from Mr. Mort's code, and create an api code using inspiration from Mr. Mortensen's code. The database will follow the following format:

| Username | Full Name | Period 1 | Period 2 | Period 3 | Period 4 | Period 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| example | Example User | Class 1,Teacher 1 | Class 2,Teacher 2 | Class 3,Teacher 3 | Class 4,Teacher 4 | Class 5,Teacher 5 |

# Video Plan

Demonstrating creating a new user, demonstrating adding a new schedule, demonstrating comparing users, demonstrating adding bad values to username, password, schedules.
