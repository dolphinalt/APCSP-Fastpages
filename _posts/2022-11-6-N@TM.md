# APCSP Project
I saw one of the groups having a tetris APCSP project that I thought was really cool. The difficult logic and coding that must have been required to create such a game must have taken a very long time and I really admire how much effort they put into this. It was also mildly amusing that they decided to make their project name "swag math games", an obvious nod to the hit website "Cool math games"

This inspired me, and gave me an idea for a project next tirmester:
 - trying to make the game myself
 - making a stat tracker for some other games (eg FPS win%)

# Art projects
I also went to see the work n the AP Studio Art classroom, and was very impressed by what I saw. Many of the drawings were extremely realistic and even looked like photographs. The many hours that must have been poured into projects like these truly show the dedication they have for this project. I also went to the ceramics classroom, and was very captivated by the banana dolphin project, as I thought it was funny and also really like dolphins. I had also gone into the Animation classroom, however didn't spend much time in it.
